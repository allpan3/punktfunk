//! Windows: [`super::manager::VirtualDisplayManager`] already leases one IddCx
//! monitor; [`acquire`] is `vd.create`, [`snapshot`]/[`release`] read it.
//!
//! Linux: a per-session pool driven by [`super::lifecycle`]. Capture on the

//! `DisplayLease`. Dropping it releases the registry refcount; the lifecycle
//! machine decides linger vs teardown.
