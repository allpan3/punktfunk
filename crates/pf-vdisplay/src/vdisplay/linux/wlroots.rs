//! wlroots/Sway virtual-output backend via sway IPC + xdg-desktop-portal-wlr.
//!
//! 1. `swaymsg create_output` adds a headless output (`HEADLESS-N`). Sway must run the
//!    headless backend (or co-load it). The name is the before/after diff of
//!    `swaymsg -t get_outputs`.
//! 2. `swaymsg output <NAME> mode --custom WxH@HzHz` sets the client's mode. A fresh
//!    headless output needs a real mode for a refresh clock or it produces no frames.
//! 3. The ScreenCast portal yields the PipeWire node. There is no GUI picker, so a
//!    managed `~/.config/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/config` sets `chooser_type=simple` and a
//!    `chooser_cmd` that cats a per-session file (`Monitor: <NAME>` — xdpw 0.8 parses
//!    that prefix strictly). Written once; the portal restarts on change.
//! 4. Teardown is ordered: drop closes the ScreenCast session and waits for the portal
//!    to confirm, then `swaymsg output <NAME> unplug` (sway ≥1.8). See [`StopGuard`].
//!
//! Requirements: `SWAYSOCK` inherited or discovered per child ([`swaymsg_command`]),
//! portal env via `scripts/headless/prepare-session.sh`, ScreenCast routed to xdpw
//! (`scripts/headless/portals.conf`).
