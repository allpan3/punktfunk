//! gamescope virtual-display backend.
//!
//! Unlike KWin/Mutter (which create a virtual output at runtime via a protocol), gamescope is a
//! micro-compositor we *spawn*: `gamescope --backend headless -W w -H h -r hz -- <app>`. It runs
//! the app nested, composites at the requested size/refresh (so the source rate is the client's
//! rate natively — no separate refresh step), and exports a built-in PipeWire node named
//! `gamescope` (media.class `Video/Source`, BGRx/NV12, dmabuf or shm) on the user's PipeWire
//! daemon. We discover that node and capture it like any other; the gamescope *process* is the
//! keepalive — dropping the [`VirtualOutput`] kills it (tearing the output down).
//!
//! Requirements: gamescope built with PipeWire + libei input emulation (distro packages are);
//! a usable Vulkan device (the NVIDIA render node). Headless capture on the proprietary NVIDIA
//! driver is plausible-by-architecture but not a well-trodden path — validate empirically.
//! Input uses gamescope's own libei/EIS socket (`LIBEI_SOCKET`), relayed to the libei backend (see
//! `inject/libei.rs`) — wired and live-validated.

///   `gamescope-session-plus`/SteamOS means no autologin gaming session to free, so
///   [`stop_autologin_sessions`] returns before it looks at the DM at all;
/// * **no packaged helper** — a tarball/source/Nix install has neither the helper nor the group,

/// Membership is read from the **user database**, not from our own `getgroups()`, because that is
