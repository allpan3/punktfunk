//! The console shell: the screen stack, the push/pop entrance/exit choreography, the
//! chrome every screen shares (pinned title, controller chip, hint bar), and the modal
//! overlays (connecting, waking, toasts). Screens draw CONTENT; the shell makes them
//! read — and move — as one coherent console.
//!
//! Transitions: a push slides the incoming screen up out of a fade while the outgoing
//! one recedes; a pop mirrors it. One eased 0→1 progress drives both layers (0.26 s,
//! ease-out cubic — the WinUI shell's entrance feel), each composited through a
//! `save_layer_alpha` so a screen fades as a unit, never element by element. The
//! backdrop crossfades in parallel when the screens disagree (aurora ↔ form).
