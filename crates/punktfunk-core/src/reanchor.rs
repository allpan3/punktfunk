//! a real IDR, an honoured [`USER_FLAG_RECOVERY_ANCHOR`], the second [`USER_FLAG_RECOVERY_POINT`]
//! since the loss, or a local recovery-point SEI ([`ReanchorGate::on_local_recovery`]).
//!
//! One shared state machine so embedders do not re-derive it. Time-driven but takes `now`
//! so tests need no clock; C ABI wrappers pass `Instant::now()`. Lanes without a bitstream
//! parser never call the local or corroborated paths; the wire contract is unchanged.
//!
//! [`USER_FLAG_RECOVERY_ANCHOR`] is a host claim about the client decoder. A parser that can
//! prove the named references were concealed passes [`AnchorEvidence::ReferencesDamaged`]
//! through [`ReanchorGate::on_decoded_corroborated`]: the freeze stays up, the backstop
//! fires on its original deadline, and the client escalates to an IDR. Silence is
