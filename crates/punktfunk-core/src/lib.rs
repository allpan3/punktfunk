//! # punktfunk-core
//!
//! The shared protocol / transport / FEC core for the punktfunk low-latency streaming
//! stack. It is compiled exactly once and linked by every host and client — directly
//! as a Rust `lib`, or across the [C ABI](crate::abi) by Swift / Kotlin / C clients.
//!
//! Everything platform-specific (capture, encode, decode, present, input injection)
//! lives *outside* this crate. What lives *here*:
//!
//! - [`fec`] — erasure coding. GF(2⁸) for GameStream/Moonlight compatibility (P1) and
//!   GF(2¹⁶) Leopard-RS (P2) which removes the ~1 Gbps per-frame shard-count ceiling.
//! - [`packet`] — `#[repr(C)]` zero-copy wire framing: splitting an access unit into
//!   FEC blocks of MTU-sized shards and reassembling them on the far side.
//! - [`crypto`] — AES-128-GCM session sealing, matching GameStream in P1.
//! - [`session`] — the host (submit frame → FEC → packetize → seal → send) and client
//!   (recv → open → reorder → FEC recover → reassemble) state machines.
//! - [`transport`] — pluggable packet I/O (in-process loopback for tests; UDP for real).
//! - [`abi`] — the `extern "C"` surface and `cbindgen`-generated `punktfunk_core.h`.
//!
//! ## Threading contract
//!
//! Nothing in the per-frame path touches an async runtime. `tokio`/`quinn` are gated
//! behind the off-by-default `quic` feature and used only for the control plane.

/// v2: `punktfunk_connect` gained `client_cert_pem`/`client_key_pem` (pairing identities);
/// added `punktfunk_pair` / `punktfunk_generate_identity` / `punktfunk_connection_request_mode`.
/// v3: added `punktfunk_wake_on_lan` (Wake-on-LAN magic packet; the host's wake MAC(s) reach
/// clients out-of-band via the mDNS `mac` TXT record, so no connection is required to wake).
/// v4: added `punktfunk_probe` (bounded, trust-agnostic, mDNS-independent reachability handshake —
/// the display-side companion to dial-first, so saved-host "online" pips reflect real reachability).
/// v5: added `punktfunk_connection_next_rumble2` (rumble pull that also yields the self-terminating
/// TTL of a v2 envelope; `punktfunk_connection_next_rumble` is unchanged and drops it). Additive —
/// the wire is backward-compatible (the envelope is a length-tolerant tail on 0xCA), so
/// [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
/// v6: added the shared-clipboard client surface — `punktfunk_connection_host_caps` and
/// `punktfunk_connection_clipboard_{control,offer,fetch,serve,cancel}` +
/// `punktfunk_connection_next_clipboard`. Additive; the wire grows only backward-compatible control
/// messages (0x40-0x44) and a new `Welcome::host_caps` bit, so [`WIRE_VERSION`] is unchanged.
