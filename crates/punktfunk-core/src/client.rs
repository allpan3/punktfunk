//! The embeddable `punktfunk/1` client connector, behind the `quic` feature.
//!
//! [`NativeClient::connect`] runs the full client side of the protocol — QUIC handshake
//! ([`crate::quic`]), UDP data plane ([`crate::session::Session`] on a native thread), input
//! datagrams — and hands the embedder a dead-simple surface: *pull reassembled access units,
//! push input events*. This is what the platform clients (SwiftUI/VideoToolbox, Android, …)
//! link via the C ABI (`punktfunk_connect` & co. in [`crate::abi`]); `punktfunk-probe` is the
//! Rust-native consumer of the same flow.
//!
//! Threading: one worker thread owns a tokio runtime (QUIC control plane only — design
//! invariant) plus a blocking data-plane pump; frames cross to the embedder over a bounded
//! channel. All methods are safe to call from any single embedder thread.
