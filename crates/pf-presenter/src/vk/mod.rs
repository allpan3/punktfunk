//! The Vulkan presenter: swapchain + several frame paths into one device-local RGBA video
//! image, then a letterboxed `vkCmdBlitImage` composite.
//!
//! * **Software** (`FrameInput::Cpu`): since M8 the CPU rung hands over tightly-packed
//!   8-bit I420 PLANES, not RGBA. They are staged into three R8 images
//!   (`CpuPlanes`, no `buffer_row_length` — the planes carry no stride) and converted by
//!   the PLANAR CSC render pass, the same pass and the same `csc_rows` coefficients the
//!   hardware lanes use. That is what deleted this lane's second colour implementation
//!   (swscale's BT.601 default) and its missing tone-map along with it.
//! * **Hardware** (`FrameInput::Dmabuf`): the decoder's NV12 dmabuf imported per-plane
//!   (`dmabuf.rs`) and converted by the two-plane CSC render pass (`csc.rs`) — zero-copy,
//!   gated on the four import extensions at device creation; boxes without them (NVIDIA
//!   proprietary by design) report `supports_dmabuf() == false` and the caller keeps the
//!   decoder on software.
//! * Plus the lanes that arrive already on this device: `NativeVk` (Vulkan Video —
//!   pf-vkdecode on this very VkDevice), `D3d11` (Windows shared textures) and
//!   `PyroWave` (three compute-decoded planes, through the same planar pass as the
//!   software lane).
//!
//! Pacing: one frame in flight (the submit fence is waited before each record), MAILBOX
//! when available, FIFO otherwise (`PUNKTFUNK_PRESENT_MODE=fifo|mailbox|immediate`
//! overrides — see `pick_present_mode` for why an arrival-paced presenter must not
//! block in FIFO's present queue). Present is arrival-paced by the caller: a frame
//! input on each decoded frame, `FrameInput::Redraw` re-blits the retained video image
//! (expose/resize redraws).
