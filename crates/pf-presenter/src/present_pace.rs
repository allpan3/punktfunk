//! The presentation intent engine (design/desktop-presentation-rebuild.md WP2): the
//! store, clock, and gate the run loop composes into the two intents.
//!
//! * [`FrameStore`] — newest-wins slot (latency) or smoothing FIFO with preroll
//!   (smoothness), ported from the Apple `FrameStore` / Android `presenter.rs` so all
//!   three clients agree on what the intents mean.
//! * [`LatchClock`] — the panel latch grid, learned from `VK_KHR_present_wait` on-glass
//!   stamps (measured, never queried — the Android refresh-rate lie and VRR both punish
//!   trusting a reported rate). Without present-wait it degrades to a grid rooted at the
//!   last submit on the mode's refresh period.
//! * [`PresentGate`] — the FIFO glass budget: one undisplayed present in flight, so the
//!   swapchain's own queue can never become a standing queue (+1 refresh per slot,
//!   forever — the law every bounded-FIFO pacing rediscovered on Apple). MAILBOX cannot
//!   queue and never needs it.
//!
//! Everything here is pure state + arithmetic on `CLOCK_REALTIME` ns (the
//! `pf_client_core::session::now_ns` domain the on-glass stamps live in); the run loop
//! owns all clocks and Vulkan calls, which is what keeps this testable.
