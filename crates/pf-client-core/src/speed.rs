//! Network speed test: one decode-less connect, one host burst, one measurement.
//!
//! Shared by every shell that offers "Test network speed…" — the Windows client's speed
//! page and its `--headless --speed-test`, and the console shell's host menu through the
//! session binary. The measurement runs over the REAL data plane, which is why it is a
//! connect and not a synthetic socket: a path that carries QUIC video is the path worth
//! measuring.
//!
//! Where the answer goes is the caller's decision, not this module's — a measured bitrate
//! belongs in the layer the tested host resolves bitrate from
//! (`design/client-settings-profiles.md` §5.3).
