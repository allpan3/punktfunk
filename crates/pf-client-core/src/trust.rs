//! Client identity, the known-hosts (pinned fingerprint) store, and app settings.
//!
//! The identity shares `~/.config/punktfunk/client-{cert,key}.pem` (Linux; on Windows
//! `%APPDATA%\punktfunk`, the WinUI shell's directory) with `punktfunk-probe` so a box
//! pairs once whichever client it uses. On Windows the session binary reads the SAME
//! stores the WinUI shell writes — pairing there makes the session connect silently,
//! mirroring the GTK-shell arrangement on Linux. The WinUI shell re-exports THIS module
//! (`clients/windows/src/trust.rs`), so both processes share one `Settings` shape; the
//! shell stays the settings file's only writer (the session only reads). Pre-unification
//! shell files (≤ 0.8.4: `show_hud`, `engine`) still load — see the migration test below.
