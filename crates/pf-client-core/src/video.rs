//! Video decode: reassembled access units → frames for the presenter.
//!
//! # The ladder (M10: native only)
//!
//! Every rung is a NATIVE rung — pf-vkdecode, pf-dxvadec, pf-vaadec, openh264/rav1d — for
//! every codec and on both desktop OSes. **There is no libavcodec in this crate at all**:
//! M10 deleted the three FFmpeg-backed rungs (`video_vulkan`, `video_vaapi`, the
//! libavcodec half of `video_d3d11`), the `video_libav` helpers they shared, `pf-ffvk` and
//! the `ffmpeg-next` dependency itself. Vendor order is unchanged
//! ([`VulkanDecodeDevice::prefer_vulkan_first`]):
//!
//! | Linux, NVIDIA/AMD | Linux, Intel/unknown | Windows, NVIDIA/AMD | Windows, Intel/unknown |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | native-vk → native-vaapi → sw | native-vaapi → native-vk → sw | native-vk → native-d3d11va → sw | native-d3d11va → native-vk → sw |
//!
//! M9's evidence FILTER survives, narrowed to the one thing it can still protect
//! ([`native_rung_admitted`]). The filter kept a rung that had never decoded on real
//! hardware out of `auto` while its proven libavcodec twin was one step below. With the
//! twins deleted that is usually no longer the situation: below native-d3d11va's AV1 leg,
//! and below native-vaapi on NVIDIA/AMD, there is nothing proven left to fall onto, so
//! barring the rung would not move a session one rung DOWN — it would take hardware decode
//! away from it entirely, which is the worse answer.
//!
//! **One column of that table is different, and it is the one the filter still guards.**
//! On Linux, Intel and every unknown vendor id run `native-vaapi → native-vk → sw`
//! ([`VulkanDecodeDevice::prefer_vulkan_first`] is true for NVIDIA and AMD only), so the
//! rung directly below the never-run pf-vaadec is native Vulkan Video — H.264 and H.265 on
//! three drivers plus a 92-minute soak, AV1 250/250. There, barring the unproven rung moves
//! the session exactly one rung down, onto proven code, so it is barred: an unproven rung
//! yields to a rung that is BOTH verified for this codec and usable on THIS device, and to
//! nothing else. A pin still reaches it — that is how the missing evidence gets generated.
//!
//! Where a rung is admitted unproven, every session SAYS so: the "decode rung active" line
//! carries `hardware_verified` and the evidence note verbatim, and it is a **warning** when
//! no hardware has ever decoded through the rung/codec pair the session just chose
//! ([`log_rung`], [`native_evidence`]). That table below is what a field report about M10
//! has to be read against.
//!
//! # Evidence — which rungs have actually decoded on hardware
//!
//! Recorded here because it is the fact a support engineer needs when a session log names
//! a rung. [`native_evidence`] is the same table in code; it is what every session logs at
//! decoder construction (`hardware_verified` / `evidence` on the "decode rung active"
//! line).
//!
//! | rung | module | codecs | hardware that has decoded on it |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | native Vulkan Video | [`crate::video_vk_native`] | H.264 | **yes** — bit-exact vs libavcodec, 250/250 AUs on three drivers + a 92-minute soak (M2 WP-D) |
//! | native Vulkan Video | | H.265 (Main / Main10 / 4:4:4) | **yes** — same parity run + HDR chain and Deck/VanGogh legs (M3) |
//! | native Vulkan Video | | AV1 | **yes** — 250/250 bit-identical to libavcodec on an RTX 5070 Ti (M7); ONE vendor, no soak |
//! | native D3D11VA | [`crate::video_d3d11_native`] | H.264, H.265 | **yes** — frame-hash parity on an RTX 4090 and an AMD iGPU + a 30-minute soak (M5) |
//! | native D3D11VA | | AV1 | **NO** — has never decoded a frame anywhere (M7 wired it; the box was unavailable) |
//! | native VAAPI | [`crate::video_vaapi_native`] | H.264, H.265, AV1 | **NO** — has never decoded a frame anywhere (M6/M7; no VAAPI hardware was reachable) |
//! | software | `video_software` | H.264, AV1 | **NO on glass** — openh264 + rav1d, CPU unit tests only (M8) |
//!
//! The software rung's evidence is recorded for the same reason but does not gate
//! anything: it is the LAST rung, so there is nothing below it to protect.
//!
//! # The rungs
//!
//! * **native Vulkan Video** (`video_vk_native`): pf-vkdecode's H.264/H.265/AV1 decoders
//!   on the PRESENTER's own VkDevice — the decoded VkImage feeds its CSC pass directly,
//!   zero copy. Admission is [`native_vulkan_gate`].
//! * **native D3D11VA** (`video_d3d11_native`, Windows): pf-dxvadec plans driven into
//!   `ID3D11VideoDecoder`, filling the field-proven shareable-texture hand-off ring in
//!   `crate::video_d3d11`.
//! * **native VAAPI** (`video_vaapi_native`, Linux): pf-vaadec plans driven into a
//!   dlopen'd libva, exporting DRM-PRIME dmabufs. NVIDIA has no usable VAAPI at all
//!   (nvidia-vaapi-driver is broken for this — Moonlight blacklists it), so device
//!   creation simply fails there and the ladder walks on.
//! * **Software**: the CPU rung, FFmpeg-free since M8 — openh264 for H.264, rav1d
//!   (dav1d) for AV1, planes uploaded straight to the presenter's planar CSC pass. It is
//!   the LAST rung, so it never demotes further; and it has no HEVC decoder at all (none
//!   exists under a permissive licence), which is a REFUSAL that reconnects the session
//!   onto a codec this client can decode — see [`last_rung_verdict`] and
//!   [`NoSoftwareRung`].
//!
//! The host encodes zero-reorder streams (no B-frames, in-band parameter sets on every
//! IDR), so decode is strictly one-in/one-out on every rung.
//!
//! Windows has no VAAPI (DRM-PRIME is a Linux concept) and Linux no DXVA; the vendor
//! order differs for one reason worth keeping in view: Intel's Windows driver DOES
//! advertise Vulkan Video (Arc drivers since 2023), but Vulkan decode on it strobed and
//! burned the frame budget (B580 field report, 2026-07 — measured on the FFmpeg-Vulkan
//! rung of the day) where DXVA streamed clean, so Intel/unknown take DXVA first and
//! NVIDIA/AMD keep Vulkan first. Everything dmabuf-shaped is
//! `cfg(target_os = "linux")`-gated inline.
//!
//! # Overrides
//!
//! `PUNKTFUNK_DECODER=native-vulkan|native-d3d11va|native-vaapi|software`. A pin skips
//! the vendor order, which is how a lab run reaches a rung `auto` would not pick on this
//! device; an init failure still logs and falls through to the standard ladder, so a pin
//! can never cost a session its decoder.
//!
//! The pre-M10 spellings `vulkan`/`vaapi`/`d3d11va` named libavcodec's rungs specifically.
//! They MIGRATE onto the native rung for the same hardware family, loudly
//! ([`migrate_decoder_pref`]) — they are not developer-only strings, every desktop
//! Settings UI offered them, and refusing them would end a session over a dropdown the
//! user picked long ago.

// `bail!` has exactly one site left and it is Windows-only (the D3D11VA rung's win32
// external-memory refusal), so the import is gated with it rather than allowed dead.
