//! Host half of `punktfunk-encode-worker` (design: `design/gpu-priority-capability-worker.md` §3;
//! plan §2/WP2). The worker half and the vocabulary they share are [`super::worker`].
//!
//! [`RemotePyroWave`] is an `Encoder` that forwards a PyroWave session to the capability-carrying
//! worker process, and it sits **under** `TrackedEncoder` — session accounting, the encode-stall
//! watchdog, encoder recovery and the forwarding rot-guard all apply to it unchanged.
//!
//! ## The ladder — no rung may kill a negotiated session
//!
//! A PyroWave open is only ever reached by a session that already negotiated PyroWave, so a hard
//! error here is a dead stream, not a fallback to another codec. Every rung therefore ends at the
//! **in-process encoder exactly as today**, at default GPU priority, with one warning:
//!
//! | rung | where | outcome |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `PUNKTFUNK_ENCODE_WORKER=off` | [`resolve_worker_path`] | in-process, one info line |
//! | binary not found | [`resolve_worker_path`] | in-process, one warn |
//! | spawn failed | [`open_preferring_worker`] | in-process, one warn |
//! | handshake timed out / worker died starting | [`spawn_link`] | in-process, one warn |
//! | proto or workspace-version skew | [`spawn_link`] | in-process, one warn |
//! | the worker could not open its encoder | [`spawn_link`] | in-process, one warn |
//! | a non-dmabuf frame arrived | [`RemotePyroWave::submit`] | in-process for the session, one warn |
//! | the worker failed a frame | [`RemotePyroWave::submit`] | in-process for the session, one warn |
//! | socket EOF mid-session | [`RemotePyroWave::reset`] | one respawn, then in-process |
//!
//! The first six happen before any frame and return the bare in-process encoder — no proxy, no
//! per-frame cost on the path that is still the overwhelming majority of hosts. The last three
//! happen inside a live proxy, which keeps its own in-process encoder from then on.
//!
//! Every fallback line ends with the same clause — *"encoding in-process at default GPU
//! priority"* — so one `grep` finds them all, whichever rung fired.
