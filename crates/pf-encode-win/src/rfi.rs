//! Slot-family RFI recovery **policy** for the three backends that answer a loss
//! with a re-reference to a known-good older frame instead of an IDR: native AMF
//! (user-LTR bitfield), native QSV (`mfxExtRefListCtrl` LTR), and Vulkan Video
//! (app-owned DPB slot table).
//!
//! Policy only. Callers feed **currently-trusted** `(slot, wire)` pairs and apply
//! the returned taints through their own persistent marker. How a force is applied
//! and how distrust is stored (AMF clears the mirror slot, QSV sets `ltr_tainted`,
//! Vulkan blanks `slot_wire` to `-1`) stays in the backend; the caller-side filter
//! is what makes those schemes equivalent under one pure function.
//!
//! Decline is also the backend's: AMF/QSV drop an un-consumed `pending_force`;
//! Vulkan leaves `pending_loss` armed so frame-build can re-pick or force an IDR.
//! Do not harmonize them here. NVENC's range policy is
//! [`super::nvenc_core::plan_range_recovery`].
