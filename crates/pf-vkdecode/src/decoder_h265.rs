//! [`VkH265Decoder`]: native Vulkan Video H.265 decode over pf-bitstream's planner.
//!
//! Per AU: `plan_au` → `plan_to_vk_h265` → slices-only ring upload → record
//! (barriers, `vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR` with every bound DPB slot, one-shot
//! session RESET, a caps-gated `RESULT_STATUS_ONLY` query around
//! `vkCmdDecodeVideoKHR`) → submit on the decode queue under the caller's
//! [`QueueLock`] with a per-image timeline signal.
//!
//! Picture format is the stream's ([`H265ProfileKey`]): Main → NV12, Main 10 →
//! P010, RExt 4:4:4 → two-plane 4:4:4. Refuse a combination the device cannot
//! host before a session exists. `RefPicSetStCurr*`/`LtCurr` name DPB slot
//! indices — bind every referenced slot or fail closed ([`crate::pic_h265`]).
//! Slice offsets are rebased onto [`pack_slices`] output (VCL only, three-byte
//! Annex-B prefix). A RASL after an open-GOP CRA is not an error (8.1.3 NOTE).
//!
//! Pool, ring, op ring, pending/ready/graveyard, and `settle_dpb`/`build_frame`
//! are shared with [`crate::VkH264Decoder`]. Codec dispatch is the client's.
