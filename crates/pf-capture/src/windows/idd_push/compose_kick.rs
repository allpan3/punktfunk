//! Last-resort DWM compose kick: synthetic pointer input that dirties one virtual

//!
//! Primary first-frame path is the driver's `FrameStash` (`frame_transport.rs`). This

//! blocked on the secure desktop, defeated by a fullscreen `ClipCursor`, and
//! user-visible on a sibling display — which is why it is a fallback.
//!
//! A cursor move dirties only the display the pointer is on, so the kick is per-target.
//! HID-first: when [`crate::HID_COMPOSE_KICK`] is registered, the report is real win32k
//! input (any session/desktop, wakes a powered-off display). `SendInput` is the remaining
//! path.

/// LAST-RESORT fallback: nudge DWM into composing THE TARGET virtual display. DWM presents a
/// display only when something DIRTIES it, so a freshly-attached ring over an idle desktop can
/// sit at E_PENDING forever. The PRIMARY first-frame mechanism is the driver's `FrameStash`
/// republish; this kick remains for pre-stash drivers and the never-composed cold start.
/// Synthetic input is inherently unreliable (secure desktop, ClipCursor, user-visible on a
/// sibling display), which is why it is the fallback.
///
/// The cursor only dirties the display it is ON (proven on-glass, Stage W3), so the kick is
/// per-TARGET: inside the target's desktop region, two net-zero 1 px relative moves; on a
/// SIBLING display, `SetCursorPos` to the target's center and back — each absolute move dirties
/// the display it lands on. Best-effort on the secure desktop, where a fresh compose just
/// happened anyway.
///
/// **COST:** the sibling-display branch SLEEPS 35 ms on the calling (capture/encode) thread —
/// the dwell is load-bearing (a sub-tick jump-and-return never dirties anything). Every call
/// site is a first-frame or recovery window with no frames flowing, and the global 50 ms
/// throttle plus the callers' 600–800 ms schedules bound the rate.
///
/// **HID-first**: a registered [`HID_COMPOSE_KICK`] (the pf-mouse virtual HID pointer) replaces
/// the `SendInput` paths — a HID report is real input to win32k regardless of session or active
/// desktop, wakes a powered-off display subsystem, and counts as user presence: every condition
/// under which `SendInput` is silently impotent (the lid-closed field-report state).
