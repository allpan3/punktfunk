//! The capturer's recovery supervisor (immunity plan WP13 wiring): feeds the pure
//! [`health::Classifier`] from the clocks the capturer keeps plus the session encoder's own
//! ([`EncoderTelemetry`]), hands its verdicts to the pure [`recovery::Coordinator`], and tells
//! the capturer which actuator to run. Same 15 s floor and "no evidence = idle" as the WP3b
//! watchdog it retired; the ladder replaces the one-rebuild-then-terminal rule.
//!
//! It runs ON the capture thread. The presentation restart is capture-thread-owned; the encoder
//! reset belongs to the stream loop, which polls for it and reports back. A `Conversion`
//! episode is proven by access units, every other class by new source frames. The host's
//! pipeline rebuild (its own 5-attempt budget) is the rung above `Failed`.
