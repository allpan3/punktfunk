//! Live capture-health classifier (vdisplay immunity plan WP12; decisions D7 "recovery follows
//! evidence" and D8 "recovery is a state machine"). PURE: it reads timestamped progress clocks the
//! capturer collected and names the class of a gap — it does no I/O, owns no thread, and fires no
//! actuator. The WP13 coordinator turns a [`HealthClass::Stalled`] verdict into its first actuator;
//! everything before that stage is a label.
//!
//! The independent clocks (D7): the driver worker's drain heartbeat, the driver's last composed
//! ACQUIRE, the ring PUBLISH, the last [`FrameOrigin::Source`](crate::FrameOrigin::Source) frame the
//! consumer received, and the last encoded access unit. Which of them kept moving through a gap is
//! what tells a starved worker from a dead ring from a presentation path that composes nothing.
//! A gap with no activity evidence at all is IDLE — a static desktop composes nothing, and that is
//! healthy — so the classifier never resets a quiet display.
