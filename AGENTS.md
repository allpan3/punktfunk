# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Writing

`scripts/ci/check-writing.sh` fails the PR. If it fails: shorten. Do not add `writing-ok`
unless the extra lines are a SAFETY/lifetime trap. Rules: `docs/writing.md`.

### Commits

- `type(scope): summary` — imperative, ≤72 characters, no trailing period, no `and`,
  no semicolon. Scope is a subsystem (`host`, `hyprland`, `abr`).
- Body: three short paragraphs max, **200 words**. Why only. No `Co-Authored-By`.
- Measurements and rejected paths go on the PR.
- Gitea PR title is the merge subject. Same shape as the commit.

Bad: `The retry loop stops eating the restore that re-lights the desk`
Good: `fix(host/hyprland): keep topology restore across pipeline retries`

### Changelog

Newest `CHANGELOG.md` section only. Two sentences per bullet: what changed, then what
the reader must do. Bold lead is a noun or an API name. Fail at 160 lines.

### Comments

Touch a function → rewrite its comment in the same diff. Do not sweep the file.

Present tense. The live rule, for someone with the file open and not the git log.
Cover the next five lines with your hand: if the comment is only interesting as
history (old versions, a scare, a soak, a ticket), delete it. Keep the invariant.
Not a poem. `// SAFETY:` is a proof, not how the bug was found.

- `//` : four lines (fail at 6). `//!` / `///` : 8–20 (fail at 24). Length is a
  backstop, not the style. A four-line war story is still wrong.
- Keep lifetime, weak-ref, why this number. One to three lines.
- A comment never enforces a trust boundary.

Bad: `A v2 host never stamps the field, so a v3 driver would refuse every attach…`
Good: `A host that leaves this field zero fails the bind.`
Bad: `Field 2026-08-28, iPad Pro / iOS 27 over Tailscale: …`
Good: `250 ms ≈ 30 refreshes at 120 Hz. A miss freezes the picture.`

### Error messages

Two registers, picked by who reads the line. Rules: `docs/writing.md` §4.

- **Operator** (`anyhow` context, `bail!`, `expect`, `#[error]`): a lowercase
  phrase naming the operation. No `failed to` / `could not` prefix, no trailing
  period. `.context("open {path}")`. A `tracing` event takes the noun phrase
  instead — `"hook command did not launch"` — with the cause in a field.
- **User** (console, TUI, tray, setup, client apps, `api_error`): one plain
  sentence of what did not happen, then the next move if there is one. No crate
  or symbol names, no errno.

Both: `Couldn't` / `can't`, never `Could not` / `cannot` / `unable to`. Append
the cause once — ` — ` in prose, `: ` in operator lines. Never a bare code.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live as Gitea issues in `unom/punktfunk` on `git.unom.io`, driven by the `gitea` MCP server
(`gh`/`glab`/`tea` do not work here), and every write needs the user's go-ahead first.
See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, each label string equal to its name — `needs-triage`, `needs-info`,
`ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix` — none of which exist in the tracker yet.
See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` at the repo root, covering the whole
workspace. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
