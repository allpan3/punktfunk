title: Uninstalling
description: Remove the Punktfunk host or client for every install method — and what each one deliberately leaves behind.
---

Every install method has a clean removal path — pick yours below. Each section also says what stays
on the machine afterwards.

> **Your configuration always survives.** Removing Punktfunk never deletes its config directory —
> `~/.config/punktfunk` on Linux, `%ProgramData%\punktfunk` for the Windows host. It holds the
> host's identity, your paired devices, the console password, `host.env`, the game library, logs,
> and [plugin](/docs/plugins) state — which is what lets a reinstall pick up where you left off.
> Each section gives the one command that clears it for a clean slate. On Linux the host also
> keeps the plugin runner's folder list in `~/.config/systemd/user/punktfunk-scripting.service.d/`.

Jump to what you installed:

- Linux host — [apt](#ubuntu-apt) · [dnf](#fedora-dnf) · [rpm-ostree layer](#fedora-atomic--bazzite-rpm-ostree-layer) · [Bazzite sysext](#bazzite--fedora-atomic-systemd-sysext) · [pacman](#arch--cachyos-pacman) · [SteamOS on-device build](#steamos--steam-deck-host-on-device-build) · [NixOS](#nixos)
- [Windows host](#windows-host) (installer or winget)
- [Clients](#clients) — Flatpak, Linux packages, Windows, macOS, iOS/tvOS, Android, Steam Deck, LG webOS
- [Plugins and the script runner](#plugins-and-the-script-runner)

## Linux hosts

If you installed with the guided script, `sh install.sh --uninstall` runs this section and the
package removal for your family in one go (fetch it again with `curl -fsSLO https://punktfunk.unom.io/install.sh`);
what it leaves behind is the same list below.

### Stop the services first

`systemctl --user enable` writes symlinks into your home directory that package removal can't see —
disable the units first, or they fail at every login:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now punktfunk-host punktfunk-web
```

Add `punktfunk-scripting` if you enabled the [plugin runner](/docs/plugins), and
`punktfunk-kde-session` if you set up the [headless KDE session](/docs/kde#headless-session).

If you turned on linger so the host ran without a login, and nothing else needs it:

```sh
sudo loginctl disable-linger "$USER"
```

Every Linux package also leaves two system groups: `punktfunk-update` (for
[one-click updates](/docs/updating)) and `punktfunk` (the virtual Steam Deck pad's usbip nodes).
Drop `punktfunk` rather than keeping it — it can present arbitrary emulated USB hardware.

### Ubuntu (apt)

```sh
sudo apt purge punktfunk-host punktfunk-web punktfunk-client punktfunk-scripting
sudo apt autoremove
```

Name only the packages you installed — the others are reported as not installed. Then drop the
repository and its key, so `apt update` stops contacting it:

```sh
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/punktfunk.list /etc/apt/keyrings/punktfunk.asc
sudo apt update
```

**Left behind:** `~/.config/punktfunk` and the two groups. Clear them with:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.config/punktfunk
sudo groupdel punktfunk-update
sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" punktfunk; sudo groupdel punktfunk
```

Your `input` group membership is harmless to keep (a stock Ubuntu group); drop it with
`sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" input` if you'd rather not have it. If you opened the firewall, close it
again: `sudo ufw delete allow punktfunk-native` (and `punktfunk-gamestream` / `punktfunk-web` if
you allowed those too). If the setup moved the management port next to Sunshine, also
`sudo ufw delete allow 47991/tcp`.

### Fedora (dnf)

The host package is called **`punktfunk`** on RPM, not `punktfunk-host`:

```sh
sudo dnf remove punktfunk punktfunk-web punktfunk-client punktfunk-scripting
sudo rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/punktfunk.repo
```

**Left behind:** `~/.config/punktfunk`, the two groups, and the signing key dnf imported into the
rpm keyring when it first installed a Punktfunk package. Clear the first two with
`rm -rf ~/.config/punktfunk`, `sudo groupdel punktfunk-update` and
`sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" punktfunk; sudo groupdel punktfunk`. The key is harmless to leave — on its
own it only marks packages from our registry as trusted, and nothing fetches them once the repo
file is gone.

On firewalld, close the ports you opened:

```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=punktfunk-native
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=punktfunk-gamestream   # if you opened it
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=punktfunk-web          # if you opened it
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=47991/tcp                 # if the setup moved the mgmt port
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Fedora Atomic / Bazzite (rpm-ostree layer)

If you layered the RPMs rather than using the sysext:

```sh
sudo rpm-ostree uninstall punktfunk punktfunk-web
systemctl reboot
```

The change only takes effect in the new deployment, so the reboot is part of the removal. Remove
`/etc/yum.repos.d/punktfunk.repo` as well if you added it. `~/.config/punktfunk` is untouched.

### Bazzite / Fedora Atomic (systemd-sysext)

The supported Bazzite path and the tidiest one — the whole install is a single image under
`/var/lib/extensions/`. Stop the services **before** you unmerge, because once the image is gone
their binaries are gone and the units just keep failing:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now punktfunk-host punktfunk-web
sudo punktfunk-sysext remove
```

`remove` deletes the image, its version sidecar, `/etc/punktfunk-sysext.conf`, the tray autostart
entry, and the gamescope session drop-in unless you edited it — then prints
`punktfunk sysext removed (user config in ~/.config/punktfunk is untouched)`.

Three things it created outside `/usr` stay behind:

```sh
sudo rm -f /etc/modules-load.d/punktfunk.conf /etc/udev/rules.d/60-punktfunk.rules
sudo groupdel punktfunk-update
sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" punktfunk; sudo groupdel punktfunk
```

And your config, if you want it gone: `rm -rf ~/.config/punktfunk`. See
[Bazzite](/docs/bazzite#1-install-the-host) for the same sequence in context.

### Arch / CachyOS (pacman)

```sh
sudo pacman -Rns punktfunk-host punktfunk-web punktfunk-gamescope \
  punktfunk-client punktfunk-scripting
```

Name only what you installed. `-Rns` also takes the dependencies nothing else needs and removes the
packages' own configuration files.

Then delete the `[punktfunk]` section (or `[punktfunk-canary]`) from `/etc/pacman.conf` — the two
lines you appended when you [added the repo](/docs/arch#2-install-the-host). Optionally drop the
repo's signing key from pacman's keyring:

```sh
sudo pacman-key --delete E0CA04465C99C936E0B0C6510A317015A34DDD69
```

**Left behind:** `~/.config/punktfunk` and the two groups — `rm -rf ~/.config/punktfunk`,
`sudo groupdel punktfunk-update`, and `sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" punktfunk; sudo groupdel punktfunk`
clear them. On CachyOS, close the ufw rules you opened: `sudo ufw delete allow punktfunk-native`,
plus `sudo ufw delete allow 47991/tcp` if the setup moved the management port.

### SteamOS / Steam Deck host (on-device build)

**There is no uninstall script for this install method.** The on-device build is spread across your
user session and a handful of root-owned files, so stop the user services first:

```sh
systemctl --user disable --now punktfunk-host punktfunk-web \
  punktfunk-scripting punktfunk-rebuild-check
rm -f ~/.config/systemd/user/punktfunk-*.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Then follow [SteamOS (Host) → Uninstalling](/docs/steamos-host#uninstalling) for the build
container, the files under your home, and the root-owned tuning. Don't skip the last of those: the
atomic-update keep list carries those files through every SteamOS update, so left alone they stay
on the device indefinitely.

**Left behind:** `~/.config/punktfunk` (`rm -rf ~/.config/punktfunk` for a clean slate), your
`input` and `punktfunk` group memberships, and — if the installer seeded it because you had none —
the KDE RemoteDesktop portal grant at `~/.local/share/flatpak/db/kde-authorized`. Drop the
`punktfunk` group once the host is gone — nothing else on a Deck uses it:
`sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" punktfunk; sudo groupdel punktfunk`.

### NixOS

There is nothing to uninstall imperatively — remove what you declared:

1. Delete the `services.punktfunk.*` options from your configuration.
2. Remove `punktfunk.nixosModules.default` from the system's module list and the `punktfunk` flake
   input.
3. Rebuild: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

The unit, udev rules, sysctl tuning, firewall ports and the `input` / `punktfunk` group memberships
all disappear with the generation. The store paths stay until you garbage-collect, and
`~/.config/punktfunk` — which the module never managed — stays regardless.

## Windows host

Uninstall from Add/Remove Programs (**Settings → Apps → Installed apps**) → **Punktfunk Host**, or,
if you installed with winget:

```powershell
winget uninstall unom.PunktfunkHost
```

Both run the same uninstaller, which removes the `PunktfunkHost` service, the scheduled tasks, the
virtual-display and gamepad drivers and every firewall rule it added — the full inventory is on
[Windows Host → Uninstalling](/docs/windows-host#uninstalling).

Three things are left on purpose:

- **`%ProgramData%\punktfunk`** — `host.env`, the host certificate and key, the management token,
  the console password, your paired devices and the logs. For a clean slate:

  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:ProgramData\punktfunk"
  ```

- **VB-CABLE**, if an older Punktfunk version installed it (releases used to bundle it for the
  microphone; current hosts use Steam's streaming drivers instead). It is a third-party VB-Audio
  component other apps may be using, so the Punktfunk uninstaller never touches it. Remove it
  with its own uninstaller — `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe -u -h` — or the **VB-Audio Virtual Cable**
  entry in Installed apps.
- **The old publisher certificate**, if you imported it by hand to silence the Unknown Publisher
  prompt on 0.28.1 or earlier. Releases since then are signed by a publicly trusted CA and never
  needed it, so it is safe to drop: remove the certificate issued to **unom** (thumbprint
  `CD1EFDEEEC9743AFC38F56C5AF30C5A3009BE941`) in `certlm.msc` under **Trusted Publishers** and
  **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**. (This is *not* the driver certificate above, which the
  uninstaller does remove.)

If you registered the winget source, drop it too — in an **admin** PowerShell, as when registering
it:

```powershell
winget source remove -n punktfunk
```

**If a Punktfunk display or gamepad survives in Device Manager** — an older build could leave one
behind — run the host's own cleanup from an elevated prompt (exactly what the uninstaller calls),
**while the host is still installed**:

```powershell
punktfunk-host driver uninstall
punktfunk-host driver uninstall --gamepad
```

If you have already uninstalled, `punktfunk-host.exe` went with it: install the current version
again and uninstall it — its uninstaller runs both commands for you.

See [Windows Host → Install](/docs/windows-host#install) for the installer's side of the same story.

## Clients

Removing a client does **not** tell the host to forget it. Unpair the device from the host's
[web console](/docs/web-console) (Pairing → unpair) if you want its pairing gone as well.

### Linux — Flatpak

```sh
flatpak uninstall --user --delete-data io.unom.Punktfunk
```

`--delete-data` clears the Flatpak's own per-app directory. It does **not** clear
`~/.config/punktfunk` — the client keeps its identity, known hosts and settings in your real config
directory (that is what lets the Flatpak, a native package and the Decky plugin share one paired
identity). Remove it with `rm -rf ~/.config/punktfunk`.

The remote it was installed from also stays. Its name depends on how you installed: if you added the
repo by hand it is **`unom`**; if you installed straight from the `.flatpakref` — the route
[Install a Client](/docs/install-client#linux-desktop-flatpak) gives — Flatpak named its own origin
remote for it. List them and delete the one that served Punktfunk, if no other app uses it:

```sh
flatpak remotes --user
flatpak remote-delete --user <name>
```

### Linux — apt / dnf / pacman packages

```sh
sudo apt purge punktfunk-client       # Ubuntu
sudo dnf remove punktfunk-client      # Fedora
sudo pacman -Rns punktfunk-client     # Arch / CachyOS
```

Then remove the repository as described under the host sections above, if this box had no host on
it. To clear the client's own state without uninstalling — saved hosts and stream settings, keeping
the paired identity — run `punktfunk reset` instead.

### Windows client (installer)

Uninstall **Punktfunk** from **Settings → Apps → Installed apps** (it's a per-user install, so no
admin prompt), or silently:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Punktfunk\unins000.exe" /VERYSILENT
```

The uninstaller removes the Start-menu entries, the `punktfunk://` registration, and its own PATH
entry. A **portable** unzip has nothing registered — just delete the folder.

### Windows client (MSIX)

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage unom.Punktfunk | Remove-AppxPackage
```

The client's saved hosts, settings and pairing identity live under `%APPDATA%\punktfunk` and are not
removed with the package — delete that folder for a clean slate. The publisher certificate you
imported to install the MSIX stays in **Trusted People**; remove it in `certlm.msc` if you're done
with Punktfunk on that machine.

### macOS

Quit Punktfunk and drag it from **Applications** to the Trash. If you installed it through
TestFlight instead, remove it from TestFlight.

### iPhone, iPad, Apple TV

Delete the app the usual way. To leave the beta entirely, open **TestFlight**, select Punktfunk, and
stop testing — that removes the app and its data with it.

### Android / Android TV

Uninstall the app from Google Play or from Settings → Apps. That's the whole job — it's a public
Play listing, so there's no tester list to leave. If you were on the invite-only **canary**
(Internal testing) track and want off that too, say so on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/wzEGg9y45z).

### Steam Deck — Decky plugin

Uninstall **Punktfunk** from Decky's own plugin list (Quick Access Menu → the **plug** icon (Decky)
→ the **gear** (Settings), where the installed plugins are listed). Decky's uninstall hook does
nothing beyond that — the two Steam shortcuts it created, the Steam Input template, the client it
launched and `~/.config/punktfunk` all survive. The step-by-step is on
[Steam Deck → Uninstalling](/docs/steam-deck#uninstalling); the client itself comes off as in
[Linux — Flatpak](#linux--flatpak) above.

### LG webOS TV

Remove the app from the TV's launcher like any other Homebrew Channel app. [`pf-webos`](https://github.com/dyptan-io/pf-webos)
is a community project — its repository is the place for anything beyond that.

## Plugins and the script runner

Plugins are installed into the host's config directory, so they survive host removal. Take them off
before you uninstall the host, or delete the directories afterwards.

```sh
punktfunk-host plugins list             # what's installed
punktfunk-host plugins remove <name>    # uninstall one
punktfunk-host plugins disable          # stop and disable the runner
```

On Windows run these from an elevated PowerShell; if `punktfunk-host` isn't on your `PATH` yet, use
the full path: `& "$env:ProgramFiles\punktfunk\punktfunk-host.exe" plugins list`.

`plugins remove` takes the plugin's code out of `plugins/`, but nothing else. These stay in the
config directory — `~/.config/punktfunk` (Linux) or `%ProgramData%\punktfunk` (Windows) — whether
you removed the plugins first or uninstalled the host with them still installed:

- `plugins/` — the plugin code itself, for any plugin you did **not** `plugins remove`.
- `plugin-state/<plugin>/` — each plugin's own config and cache, including any API keys you put in
  a plugin's `config.json`. `plugins remove` does not touch this.
- `plugin-token` — the runner's scoped credential for the management API.

Deleting the whole config directory removes all three. The runner package itself
(`punktfunk-scripting` on Linux) comes off with your package manager, as in the sections above; on
Windows it is part of the host installer and goes with it.

## Removing the pairing, not the software

To undo only a pairing, you don't need to uninstall anything. The two halves are separate:

- **On the host** — unpair the device from the [web console](/docs/web-console); it stops being
  trusted immediately.
- **On a Linux client** — `punktfunk-client --forget-host <fingerprint|host[:port]>` drops a saved
  host from that client's list.
- **On a Linux or Windows client** — the headless `punktfunk` command that ships with the same
  package does both jobs: `punktfunk hosts forget <host-ref>` for one host, `punktfunk reset` for
  all of them plus the stream settings (the client keeps its identity, so a re-pair doesn't look
  like a brand-new device).

See [Pairing](/docs/pairing) for the full model.
