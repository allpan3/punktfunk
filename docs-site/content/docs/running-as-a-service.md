title: Running as a Service
description: Start the host at boot — for a desktop you log into, or a fully headless always-on machine.
---

Running `serve` in a terminal is fine for trying Punktfunk out. To make a machine an
always-available host, run it as a service. First, what that service starts — then the two cases, a
desktop you log into and a fully headless box.

## What the unit starts

The bundled unit runs `serve --gamestream`, so it serves both the native `punktfunk/1` plane and
stock [Moonlight](/docs/moonlight) clients. Every Linux package installs that unit as it ships and
only rewrites the binary path, so a host you installed from apt, dnf, pacman or the Bazzite sysext
has **GameStream on**. See what yours starts:

```sh
systemctl --user cat punktfunk-host
```

For a **native-only** host (no GameStream — its pairing runs over plain HTTP and its legacy
encryption is weaker; see [Security & Safe Use](/docs/security)), drop the flag. The packaged unit is
a package file that an upgrade replaces, so override `ExecStart` with a drop-in rather than editing
it:

```sh
systemctl --user edit punktfunk-host
```

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/punktfunk-host serve
```

The empty `ExecStart=` is required — without it systemd adds a second command instead of replacing
the first — and the path must match the one `systemctl --user cat` printed (the distro packages use
`/usr/bin`). Save, then `systemctl --user restart punktfunk-host`.

Windows is the other way round: an install from the setup `.exe` leaves GameStream **off** unless you
tick it, and it is configured differently — see [Windows](#windows) below.

## A. A desktop you log into

If you sit at the machine (or it auto-logs-in to a desktop), run the host as a **systemd user
service** that starts with your session.

**Put your `host.env` in place first.** The unit reads `~/.config/punktfunk/host.env` and won't start
until that file exists — no package creates it for you, they only ship a template to copy. The
defaults in it are right for an ordinary desktop; your distro and desktop guides say if yours wants
a different template (on Bazzite it's `host.env.bazzite`):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/punktfunk
# /usr/share/punktfunk/ on Fedora/Arch/Bazzite, /usr/share/punktfunk-host/ on Ubuntu
cp /usr/share/punktfunk/host.env.example ~/.config/punktfunk/host.env
```

**Installed from a package** (apt, dnf, pacman, or the Bazzite sysext) — the unit is already at
`/usr/lib/systemd/user/punktfunk-host.service`, with its `ExecStart` pointing at the installed
binary. There's nothing to copy:

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload             # the sysext route needs this; harmless elsewhere
systemctl --user enable --now punktfunk-host
```

**Built from source** — install the unit from your checkout, and take `host.env` from there too
(`cp scripts/host.env.example ~/.config/punktfunk/host.env`). The unit's `ExecStart` points at
`%h/punktfunk/target/release/punktfunk-host` (`%h` is your home directory), so edit the copy if your
checkout lives somewhere else:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp scripts/punktfunk-host.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now punktfunk-host
```

Don't do the copy on a packaged install: a unit in `~/.config/systemd/user/` shadows the packaged
one, and the source unit points at a build tree you don't have — the service then fails with
`status=203/EXEC`.

The host now starts whenever you log in. Check it with `systemctl --user status punktfunk-host`.

**You don't need to export anything for it.** The host finds the live compositor session itself on
every connect and works out where to reach it (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, the session bus,
sway's `SWAYSOCK`, Hyprland's instance signature) from the running compositor — so `host.env` is for
policy, not session plumbing, and `systemctl --user import-environment` is not a prerequisite.

### Restart the host with your desktop

Add one drop-in so the host follows your session's lifetime:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/punktfunk-host.service.d
# /usr/share/punktfunk/ on Fedora/Arch/Bazzite, /usr/share/punktfunk-host/ on Ubuntu,
# scripts/ in a source checkout
cp /usr/share/punktfunk/punktfunk-host-desktop-session.conf \
   ~/.config/systemd/user/punktfunk-host.service.d/desktop-session.conf
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user reenable punktfunk-host
systemctl --user restart punktfunk-host
```

Without it, restarting Plasma or GNOME — a crash, a log out and back in, "restart the shell" — leaves
the host running against a compositor that no longer exists. It keeps listening and answering, and
every session after that fails at capture, which is a confusing way to find out. The drop-in makes a
compositor restart a host restart.

Skip it on the headless/appliance route below (which has its own session unit), and on **Sway or
Hyprland**, which don't hand their session to systemd: they never reach `graphical-session.target`, so
the drop-in is harmless there but does nothing. To make the host come and go with the session on
those, start it from the compositor's own config instead of enabling the unit — add
`exec systemctl --user start punktfunk-host` to your sway config, or
`exec-once = systemctl --user start punktfunk-host` to Hyprland's — and leave the unit itself
disabled (`systemctl --user disable punktfunk-host`), so it isn't also started at login.

## B. A headless, always-on host

To run with **no monitor and no login** — a machine in a closet that's always ready — you need two
things: a desktop session that comes up at boot, and the host service started without a login.

Start by making the host service start at boot even when nobody logs in:

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

Then bring up a session automatically. How you do that is desktop-specific — auto-login, lock
disable, and the session unit differ per compositor, so each is documented on its own page:

- GNOME: [GNOME → Headless session](/docs/gnome#headless-session).
- KDE Plasma: [KDE → Headless session](/docs/kde#headless-session).
- Steam / gamescope: [gamescope](/docs/gamescope) — the host launches its own session per client, so
  there's no separate session unit. A headless box that autologins into **Gaming Mode** needs one
  more thing: your user in the `punktfunk` group (`sudo usermod -aG punktfunk "$USER"`, then log
  out and back in). Without it the host cannot stop the display manager to take that session over,
  so every connect quietly mirrors the box's own screen — which, headless, is a black one. See
  [gamescope → autologin display managers](/docs/gamescope#nobara-and-other-autologin-display-managers).

Once a session comes up at boot, enable the host user service (section A) and reboot. The host comes up
on that session.

### Headless Bazzite

On Bazzite, the host launches its own gamescope/Steam session per client, so you don't need a separate
session unit — see [Bazzite](/docs/bazzite) and [gamescope](/docs/gamescope).

## Windows

> Punktfunk has first-class **Linux and Windows** hosts. On Windows it ships as a signed installer
> with an SCM service and a virtual-display driver — including Punktfunk's own **indirect display
> driver** the host pushes frames straight into. The Windows host is newer than the Linux host. (Not
> to be confused with the Windows *client*, which streams *to* a Windows PC.)

On Windows the host runs as a `LocalSystem` service that launches into the interactive session, so it
captures the secure desktop (UAC / lock screen) and survives reboots with nobody logged in — the same
model Sunshine/Apollo use. Because it runs at that privilege level, keep it on a trusted network and be
deliberate about which machine you host on — see [Security & Safe Use](/docs/security).

The easy path is the **signed installer**: download `punktfunk-host-setup-<ver>.exe` from the package
registry ([`punktfunk-host-windows`](https://git.unom.io/unom/-/packages)) and run it. It drops the host
into `C:\Program Files\punktfunk`, installs the bundled **pf-vdisplay** virtual-display driver, and
registers + starts the service for you (`/VERYSILENT` for unattended). Upgrades and uninstall are
handled through Add/Remove Programs.

Prefer the CLI? Run `punktfunk-host service install` from an elevated prompt — see
[Windows Host](/docs/windows-host). For hardware encode you need a GPU — NVIDIA (NVENC), AMD (AMF), or
Intel (QSV); the host falls back to software H.264 without one.

**GameStream on Windows.** Unlike the Linux unit, the installer leaves Moonlight compatibility
**off** — it's a checkbox in the wizard (`/MERGETASKS="gamestream"` to select it unattended). There's
no `ExecStart` to edit here: the service launches whatever `PUNKTFUNK_HOST_CMD` in
`%ProgramData%\punktfunk\host.env` says, which is also where the rest of the Windows host's
configuration lives. To change it later, from an elevated prompt:

```powershell
punktfunk-host service install --gamestream=on   # or --gamestream=off
punktfunk-host service restart
```

Registering the service by hand is the exception. A bare `punktfunk-host service install` writes a
fresh `host.env` with `PUNKTFUNK_HOST_CMD` left commented out, and with no value set the service
falls back to `serve --gamestream` — so add `--gamestream=off` to that command if you want the
native-only host.

> **Firewall scope.** The installer opens the streaming + console ports on **Private and Domain**
> networks only — not **Public**. If your LAN is (mis)classified Public, clients won't connect until
> you set it to Private (Windows Settings → Network), and the host logs a warning when it's on a Public
> network. For a trusted network Windows insists is Public, tick **"Allow connections on Public
> networks"** at install (or pass `--allow-public-network` to `service install`). See
> [Security & Safe Use](/docs/security) for the reasoning.

## Verifying

After a reboot, from another machine on the network:

```sh
punktfunk reachable 192.168.1.50   # exit 0 = the host answered, 2 = it didn't
punktfunk hosts list --probe       # every saved host, online or offline
```

`punktfunk` is the headless client CLI — it ships in the Linux client packages (`punktfunk-client`)
and with the Windows client. From a source checkout, `punktfunk-probe --discover` browses the LAN
instead; it's a dev tool and isn't packaged. Or just open a native client / Moonlight and look for
the host.

If the host answers, it's up. If not, check `journalctl --user -u punktfunk-host` on the host — on
a Windows host, run `punktfunk-host service status` from an elevated prompt on the machine itself.

## GPU scheduling priority

The host binary carries **no Linux capability**, and on a KDE desktop it must not.

The [PyroWave](/docs/pyrowave) codec encodes on the same GPU shader cores your game is using, so a
demanding game can crowd it out and the stream's frame rate drops with it. The fix is to ask the
driver to schedule the encode ahead of the game, and every driver we tested gates that request on
`CAP_SYS_NICE`. Version 0.26.0-1 granted it for that reason — and it broke desktop streaming on
every KDE box, so 0.26.0-2 takes it away again. The other codecs use a separate video engine on the
GPU and were never affected.

The two cannot coexist. To hand the host its virtual display, KWin first has to work out *which*
program is asking, which it does by reading the connecting process's `/proc/<pid>/exe` and matching
it against the `.desktop` file the packages install. Linux refuses that read for any process holding
a capability the reader does not also hold — and KWin holds none. So a host with `CAP_SYS_NICE` is a
host KWin cannot identify, and every session fails with:

```
KWin virtual output failed: KWin does not expose zkde_screencast_unstable_v1 to this client
```

which looks exactly like a missing `.desktop` file and cannot be fixed by reinstalling. Moving the
grant into the systemd unit does not help either — same capability, same refused read.

If you are on 0.26.0-1, update. On the Bazzite image the `/usr` is read-only, so the only repair is
the next image (`sudo punktfunk-sysext update`). Elsewhere you can clear it by hand:

```sh
getcap /usr/bin/punktfunk-host          # prints nothing when correct
sudo setcap -r /usr/bin/punktfunk-host  # clear it, then restart the host
```

Losing the capability costs frame pacing under a GPU-bound game and nothing else — the host asks for
the elevated priority, is refused, and encodes at the normal one. `PYROWAVE_QUEUE_PRIORITY=off`
stops it asking at all. If you stream only with gamescope (Steam Gaming Mode) you can grant the
capability yourself and keep the pacing, at the cost of desktop streaming; gamescope has no such
identity check.

## Stopping and removing

After a Linux package update the user service keeps running the old binary until it's restarted, and
a package can't restart another user's `--user` units for you — [Updating](/docs/updating) has the
update command for every install method and the restart that finishes the job. The Windows installer
restarts its own service.

To stop the host for now:

```sh
systemctl --user stop punktfunk-host          # Linux
punktfunk-host service stop                   # Windows, elevated prompt
```

To stop it for good, so it doesn't come back at login or boot:

```sh
# add punktfunk-web (the console) and punktfunk-kde-session (the headless KDE route) if you enabled them
systemctl --user disable --now punktfunk-host
rm -rf ~/.config/systemd/user/punktfunk-host.service.d   # any drop-ins you added
sudo loginctl disable-linger "$USER"                     # only if you enabled lingering
```

On Windows, `punktfunk-host service uninstall` from an elevated prompt stops the service, removes it,
and removes the firewall rules it added. To remove the whole install instead, use Add/Remove Programs.

Neither removes `~/.config/punktfunk` (Linux) or `%ProgramData%\punktfunk` (Windows) — your
certificate, pairings and console password stay, so a reinstall picks up where you left off. See
[Uninstall](/docs/uninstall) to clear them out.
