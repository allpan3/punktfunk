title: Install a Client
description: Install the Punktfunk client for the device you're streaming to — Linux, Steam Deck, Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.
---

This page is the **install path for each client device**. For what each client *is* and which to
pick, see [Clients](/docs/clients); to install the **host**, see [Install the Host](/docs/install).
Every client needs a one-time [pairing](/docs/pairing) on its first connection. If the app installs
but your host doesn't appear in its list, start at [Troubleshooting → The host isn't found on the
network](/docs/troubleshooting#the-host-isnt-found-on-the-network).

Already installed? Skip to [Keeping a client up to date](#keeping-a-client-up-to-date) or
[Removing a client](#removing-a-client).

> The links below are the **stable** channel (moves on `vX.Y.Z` releases). For the latest `main`
> build, use the **canary** channel — TestFlight / Play Internal, the `…Canary.flatpakref`, or the
> `canary/` download URLs. See [Release Channels](/docs/channels).

## Pick your device

| Device | Install |
|--------|---------|
| **Linux** desktop / laptop | [Flatpak](#linux-desktop-flatpak) (any distro) or native apt/rpm/Arch packages |
| **Steam Deck** | [Decky plugin](/docs/steam-deck) for Gaming Mode, or [Flatpak in Desktop Mode](#steam-deck) |
| **Windows** | [Signed installer](#windows) from the package registry (portable zip and MSIX too) |
| **macOS** | [Notarized `.dmg`](#macos) from the releases page |
| **iPhone / iPad / Apple TV** | [TestFlight beta](#ios-ipados-apple-tv) |
| **Android / Android TV** | [Google Play](#android), or sideload the APK |
| **LG webOS TV** | [Community client](#lg-webos-tv-community) (sideloaded `.ipk`) |
| Anything else (browser, old phone, TV) | [Moonlight](/docs/moonlight) |

## Linux desktop (Flatpak)

The **recommended** path on any Flatpak distro. One command adds the signed `unom` remote, pulls the
GNOME runtime from Flathub automatically, and installs the client:

```sh
flatpak install --user https://flatpak.unom.io/io.unom.Punktfunk.flatpakref
flatpak run io.unom.Punktfunk
```

Updates, from then on — **without `sudo`** (this is a `--user` install; `sudo flatpak update` only
touches the *system* scope and silently skips it):

```sh
flatpak update                       # or: flatpak update --user io.unom.Punktfunk
```

Prefer your native package manager? Add the repo once (see the linked guide); updates then ride your
normal `apt upgrade` / `dnf upgrade` / `pacman -Syu` (a *layered* Atomic install needs
[one extra step](#keeping-a-client-up-to-date)):

| Distro | Install | Guide |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Ubuntu 26.04 or newer** | `sudo apt install punktfunk-client` | [packaging/debian](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/src/branch/main/packaging/debian/README.md) |
| **Fedora** | `sudo dnf install punktfunk-client` | [Fedora](/docs/fedora) for the `/etc/yum.repos.d/punktfunk.repo` block (pick the group matching your release), then [packaging/rpm](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/src/branch/main/packaging/rpm/README.md) |
| **Fedora Atomic / Bazzite** | The Flatpak above — no layering. `rpm-ostree install punktfunk-client` only if you already layer packages | [Bazzite](/docs/bazzite) for why layering is a last resort; [packaging/rpm](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/src/branch/main/packaging/rpm/README.md) for the `bazzite` group repo block |
| **Arch** | `sudo pacman -Syu punktfunk-client` (signed binary repo) | [Arch Linux](/docs/arch) |

> **The client `.deb` needs SDL3 and GTK4 ≥ 4.20**, which Ubuntu 24.04 LTS doesn't ship, so
> `apt install punktfunk-client` can't resolve there. On 24.04 (or any older distro) use the
> **Flatpak above** — it carries its own libadwaita and SDL3. The limit is the *client's* alone: the
> host `.deb` is built separately and installs on 24.04 LTS through 26.04.

Then launch it, pick your host from the list, and stream. Every one of these packages — Flatpak
included — also installs the headless **`punktfunk`** command for scripts:

```sh
punktfunk hosts list --probe    # saved hosts, each with a live reachability check
punktfunk launch <host-ref>     # stream to one, waking it first if it's asleep
```

Under the Flatpak, reach it as `flatpak run --command=punktfunk io.unom.Punktfunk hosts list`.
The older `punktfunk-client --connect <host>:9777` still works for existing scripts. Full verb
list: [Clients → the `punktfunk` CLI](/docs/clients#scripting-the-punktfunk-cli).

## Steam Deck

Most Deck users want **Gaming Mode**: the **[Decky plugin](/docs/steam-deck)** puts a **Punktfunk**
panel in the Quick Access Menu — find a host, get let in (a PIN, or a request the host's operator
approves), and stream **without dropping to the desktop**; settings, the game library and adding a
host by address are one tap away in the client's own gamepad UI. That guide walks through Decky
Loader, the plugin, and the one-time client install.

> The plugin doesn't decode video itself — it drives whichever `punktfunk-client` is installed on
> the Deck. The Flatpak below is the tested default; a native package or a sysext works too. If your
> client isn't one the plugin can update for you (a sysext, a nix profile, a source build), the panel
> shows you the update command instead of an **Update** button. The Gaming Mode panel comes from the
> plugin, so a client on its own won't add it; the Decky guide covers installing both.

For **Desktop Mode** (or to add the client to Game Mode as a non-Steam app yourself), install the
Flatpak exactly as [above](#linux-desktop-flatpak) — it carries its own libadwaita + SDL3 and
survives SteamOS updates:

```sh
flatpak install --user https://flatpak.unom.io/io.unom.Punktfunk.flatpakref
```

See [packaging/flatpak](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/src/branch/main/packaging/flatpak/README.md).

## Windows

The Windows client ships as a **signed installer** in the package registry, signed with a publicly
trusted certificate — nothing to import or trust by hand. It installs per-user (no admin prompt) to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Punktfunk`.

1. Download the installer. Each channel keeps one fixed URL, so this line always fetches the
   current build — in PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   curl.exe -LO https://git.unom.io/api/packages/unom/generic/punktfunk-client-windows/latest/punktfunk-client-setup_x64.exe
   ```

   Swap `_x64` for `_arm64` on an Arm device, and `latest` for `canary` to track `main`. The same
   file is attached to every [release](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/releases), and every
   build is kept under its own version on the
   [packages page](https://git.unom.io/unom/-/packages) (generic group, `punktfunk-client-windows`).
2. Run it. The installer registers `punktfunk://` links, puts the headless `punktfunk` command on
   your PATH, and fetches the
   [Windows App Runtime 2.x](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads)
   automatically if this PC doesn't have it yet.
3. Launch **Punktfunk** from the Start menu and pick your host. A second entry, **Punktfunk
   Console**, is the same client as a controller-driven fullscreen interface for a TV or HTPC.

### Launching through Steam (overlay, Big Picture)

Because the client is a normal exe at a stable path, you can hand it to Steam: **Add a Non-Steam
Game** → browse to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Punktfunk\punktfunk-client.exe` (or
`punktfunk-console.exe` for the couch interface). Launched that way, the **Steam overlay** and
controller configs work in the stream, and it's launchable from **Big Picture**. This is exactly
what the older MSIX package couldn't do — Steam can neither browse nor inject into an app under
`WindowsApps` — so if you set that up before, reinstall with the installer above and re-add it.

### Portable zip and MSIX

Two alternates, same signed binaries, published next to the installer on every build:

- **Portable** — `…/latest/punktfunk-client-windows_x64-portable.zip`: unzip anywhere and run
  `punktfunk-client.exe`. Nothing is registered, so `punktfunk://` links and the `punktfunk`
  command on PATH stay with the installer. Needs the
  [Windows App Runtime 2.x](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads)
  installed once.
- **MSIX** — `…/latest/punktfunk-client-windows_x64.msix`, kept for Microsoft Store
  compatibility: `Add-AppxPackage .\punktfunk-client-windows_x64.msix`. If Windows reports a
  missing dependency, install the Windows App Runtime 2.x above and re-run it. Install from a
  signed-in desktop session — over SSH/RMM, `Add-AppxPackage` can fail with `0x80070005`. Note the
  Steam integration above does **not** work from the MSIX.

> The Windows client's hardware decode and HDR10 present are validated on glass on NVIDIA and Intel
> (including HDR pass-through on the Intel D3D11VA path). If anything misbehaves,
> **[Moonlight](/docs/moonlight)** is a solid alternative for Windows.

## macOS

Download `Punktfunk-<version>.dmg` from the [releases page](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/releases).
It's Developer-ID signed, notarized, and stapled, so Gatekeeper opens it without warnings:

1. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Punktfunk** to **Applications**.
2. Launch it, pick your host from *On this network*, and [pair](/docs/pairing).

The Mac app is also in the [TestFlight beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Qr7uSemk); the DMG
is the no-account path.

## iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV

The Apple app is in **TestFlight** beta — one universal build covers iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and the
Mac. Install Apple's [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664) app, then join:

**[Join the Punktfunk beta on TestFlight →](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Qr7uSemk)**

Open the app; your hosts appear automatically under *On this network*.

## Android

The Android client (phone + Android TV — one package; the TV layout is the same app in leanback
mode) is on **Google Play** as a public listing: no invite, no tester list.

**[Get Punktfunk on Google Play →](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.unom.punktfunk)**

Install it, open the app, and pick your host.

**Prefer not to go through Play?** The signed APK is published publicly on every build — sideload it
instead, no Play account needed:

```text
https://git.unom.io/api/packages/unom/generic/punktfunk-android/latest/punktfunk-android.apk
```

Swap `latest` for `canary` to track `main`. Release APKs are also attached to each
[release](https://git.unom.io/unom/punktfunk/releases). Android asks you to allow installs from your
browser or file manager the first time.

**Canary on Play** is a separate **Internal testing** track, and that one *is* invite-only — ask on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/wzEGg9y45z) and we'll add your Google account. The `canary` APK above
needs no invite.

## LG webOS TV (community)

> **Community project.** [`pf-webos`](https://github.com/dyptan-io/pf-webos) is built and maintained
> by [dyptan-io](https://github.com/dyptan-io), not the Punktfunk team — file issues and bugs on
> [its own repo](https://github.com/dyptan-io/pf-webos/issues).

LG's webOS doesn't allow apps outside the LG Content Store without sideloading, so install needs
**Developer Mode** and the **Homebrew Channel** once:

1. Enable Developer Mode on the TV and install the [Homebrew Channel](https://www.webosbrew.org/) —
   its [install guide](https://www.webosbrew.org/guide/getting-started.html) covers it if you
   haven't done this before.
2. Grab the latest `.ipk` from the
   [pf-webos releases page](https://github.com/dyptan-io/pf-webos/releases/latest).
3. Install it: sideload with `ares-install` / the project's `task deploy TV_HOST=root@<tv-ip>` (see
   the repo's README), or copy the `.ipk` onto the TV and install it from the Homebrew Channel's
   app.
4. Launch **Punktfunk** from the TV's launcher, discover your host over LAN (or add it by IP), and
   [pair](/docs/pairing) with a PIN.

## Anything else — Moonlight

Any device with a [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) client (browser, old phone, smart TV)
connects over GameStream with no punktfunk-specific software. See
[Connect with Moonlight](/docs/moonlight).

## Keeping a client up to date

Every platform is released from one tag. A client and a host don't have to be on the same version,
but keeping them close is the least surprising. (Updating the **host** is its own page:
[Updating](/docs/updating).)

| Client | How it updates |
|---|---|
| **Linux Flatpak** | `flatpak update --user io.unom.Punktfunk` — **without `sudo`** (see the [Flatpak section](#linux-desktop-flatpak)) |
| **Linux apt / dnf / pacman** | your normal `sudo apt upgrade` / `sudo dnf upgrade` / `sudo pacman -Syu`, or the app's own updater below |
| **Fedora Atomic (layered)** | `rpm-ostree upgrade` on its own is not enough — see the note below the table |
| **Windows installer** | download the newer `punktfunk-client-setup_<arch>.exe` as in [Windows](#windows) and run it — it upgrades in place, keeping your saved hosts and pairing. Switching **from the MSIX**, see the note below the table |
| **Windows MSIX / portable** | no self-update — download the newer `.msix` and re-run `Add-AppxPackage` (from **0.28.1 or earlier**, see the note below the table), or unzip the newer portable build over the old one |
| **macOS `.dmg`** | download the newer `Punktfunk-<version>.dmg` and drag it over the copy in Applications |
| **iOS / iPadOS / tvOS** | TestFlight updates it |
| **Android** | Google Play updates it; if you sideloaded, download the APK again and install over it |
| **Steam Deck (Decky)** | the panel's **Update** button — see [Steam Deck → Updating](/docs/steam-deck#updating) |
| **LG webOS** | install the newer `.ipk` the same way you installed the first one |

**Fedora Atomic, if you layered the client.** `rpm-ostree upgrade` upgrades the *base image* and
only re-resolves layered packages when that base changes — on a base that sits still it keeps
reporting no updates while a newer `punktfunk-client` waits in the repo. Force a re-resolve of just
that layer, in one transaction, then reboot to activate it:

```sh
sudo rpm-ostree refresh-md --force
sudo rpm-ostree update --uninstall punktfunk-client --install punktfunk-client
systemctl reboot
```

The client's own updater below runs exactly that for you. (A layered **host** has the same trap —
[Updating](/docs/updating) covers it.)

**Windows, coming from 0.28.1 or earlier — uninstall first.** Those builds were signed with our own
self-signed certificate. The move to a publicly trusted one changes the package's *publisher*, and an
MSIX's identity is its name **plus** its publisher — so Windows treats the new package as a different
app, not an update, and installing it leaves you with two **Punktfunk** entries. Remove the old one
first, then install the new `.msix` as above:

```powershell
Get-AppxPackage *Punktfunk* | Remove-AppxPackage
```

This is one-time; releases after that upgrade in place. A packaged app's settings live *inside* its
package, so removing the old one also removes this client's identity and its paired hosts — expect
to [pair](/docs/pairing) again once. Nothing on the host side is affected.

**Switching from the MSIX to the installer** (for the [Steam integration](#launching-through-steam-overlay-big-picture),
or just to follow the new default): remove the MSIX first — `Get-AppxPackage unom.Punktfunk |
Remove-AppxPackage` — then run the installer. Same caveat as above: the packaged app's saved hosts
and pairing identity go with the package, so expect to pair again once.

### The Linux client can update itself

The native Linux client checks its own channel and can apply the update in place, whichever package
manager installed it:

```sh
punktfunk-client --check-update    # prints installed vs available for this box's channel
punktfunk-client --apply-update    # install it
```

`--check-update` is scriptable: it exits **0** when you're up to date, **10** when an update is
available, and **1** when it couldn't tell (offline, or the check is disabled) — "couldn't tell" is
deliberately not "up to date". Add `--json` to either for machine-readable output.

Applying an update needs root, so it's **opt-in**: join the `punktfunk-update` group once, and a
packaged root helper does the install (the same group and grant as the host's one-click updating,
described in [Updating](/docs/updating)).

```sh
sudo usermod -aG punktfunk-update $USER
```

Membership is re-read on every check, so no need to log out and back in. Without it,
`--check-update` prints the opt-in line and the plain package-manager command instead. On a Flatpak
install `--apply-update` isn't used — the client tells you to run `flatpak update`.

## Removing a client

The removal command for every client, and what removal deliberately leaves behind — this device's
identity and its saved hosts, and the pairing on the host — are on
[Uninstalling → Clients](/docs/uninstall#clients). The same page covers forgetting your saved hosts
[without uninstalling anything](/docs/uninstall#removing-the-pairing-not-the-software), and removing
the **host**.
