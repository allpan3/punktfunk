description: Common problems setting up or using a Punktfunk host, and how to fix them.
---

## Another streaming host (Sunshine, Apollo, …) is installed

Punktfunk's Moonlight-compatible mode and **Sunshine** / its forks (**Apollo**, **Vibeshine**,
Vibepollo, LuminalShine, …) bind the *same* GameStream ports, advertise the *same* `_nvstream` mDNS
name, and on Windows often install a *conflicting virtual-display driver* — and even native-only,
Punktfunk's management API and their web UI both want **TCP 47990**. The symptoms: `address already
in use` in the host log, pairing that silently fails, the wrong host answering a client, display
glitches, or a host that "worked until one day it didn't" (a boot race for 47990: Punktfunk exits
when it loses, Sunshine just loses its config page).

- **Check:** `punktfunk-host detect-conflicts` lists every Sunshine-family host it finds and exits
  **1 only if one is running or set to start on its own** — a dormant leftover (files on disk, a
  disabled service) prints but exits 0. The host logs the same finding at startup (so it's on the
  console's **Logs** page) and carries it in the status summary; the Windows installer warns
  before installing on the same rule. `ss -lptn 'sport = :47990'` (Linux) /
  `netstat -ano | findstr :47990` (Windows) shows who holds the port right now.
- **Fix:** stop and uninstall the other host (`sudo systemctl disable --now sunshine`; on Windows
  `sc stop SunshineService`, then its uninstaller and its display driver), then start Punktfunk.
- **Keeping both for a while?** Leave GameStream compat off and move Punktfunk's management port
  (`PUNKTFUNK_MGMT_BIND`), and on Windows pick a non-exclusive display topology — the whole recipe,
  and what maps to what when you migrate, is on
  [Switching from Sunshine](/docs/switching-from-sunshine).

## The host isn't found on the network

- Make sure the host is actually running — on Linux `systemctl --user status punktfunk-host` (or you
  see it listening in the terminal); on Windows `punktfunk-host service status`, and if it isn't
  running see [Windows: the host or the web console won't
  start](#windows-the-host-or-the-web-console-wont-start).
- **On an Android phone or TV, check the app's local-network permission.** On Android 17 and newer,
  Android blocks Punktfunk from touching anything on your LAN — discovery, the connect itself,
  Wake-on-LAN, the game library — until you allow it. The app asks when you open the host list, and
  a denial looks exactly like a host that isn't there. Tap **Allow…** under
  *Local network access is off* at the top of the host list, or enable **Nearby devices** for
  Punktfunk in Android's app settings.
- Host and client must be on the **same network/subnet**. Discovery uses mDNS, which doesn't cross
  routed subnets or most VPNs-without-multicast. As a fallback, add the host by **IP address** in your
  client.
- A firewall on the host can block it. The native protocol needs **two** fixed UDP ports open:
  **9777** (the QUIC control plane) and **5353** (mDNS — this is the one discovery itself runs on).
  On Linux the packages ship a ready-made `punktfunk-native` rule that opens both, plus TCP 47990 for
  the library API:

  ```sh
  sudo ufw allow punktfunk-native                              # ufw (CachyOS, Ubuntu)
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=punktfunk-native \
    && sudo firewall-cmd --reload                              # firewalld (Fedora, some Arch spins)
  ```

  The per-session **data plane** rides a *separate, random* UDP port and usually needs **no** firewall
  rule (see [Video is slow to start, or fails across
  subnets](#video-is-slow-to-start-or-fails-across-subnets) for why, and the one case where opening it
  helps). GameStream/Moonlight (only with `--gamestream`) uses TCP **47984/47989/48010** + UDP
  **47998/47999/48000** (video/FEC 47998, ENet control 47999, audio 48000) + mDNS UDP **5353** —
  that's the packages' `punktfunk-gamestream` rule.
- **On a Windows host, check the network profile.** The installer opens the streaming and console
  ports on **Private** and **Domain** networks only. If Windows has classified your LAN as **Public**,
  no client can reach the host — the host logs a warning at startup when it sees this. Set the network
  to Private in **Windows Settings → Network & internet → your network → Network profile type**.
  For a trusted network Windows insists on marking Public, the installer's *Allow connections on
  Public networks* option (unattended: `/MERGETASKS="allowpublicfw"`) opts in — but it only takes
  effect on a **first** install, so on a PC that already has the host, re-scope the streaming ports
  from an elevated prompt instead:

  ```powershell
  punktfunk-host service install --allow-public-network=on
  ```

  That leaves your GameStream choice and the rest of `host.env` alone. It covers the streaming ports;
  the web console's own rule for TCP 47992 keeps the scope it was installed with. See
  [Running as a Service → Windows](/docs/running-as-a-service#windows).

## The Linux host service won't start

`systemctl --user status punktfunk-host` shows it failed instead of running. Two common causes:

- **There's no `host.env` yet.** The packaged unit reads `~/.config/punktfunk/host.env` and won't
  start until that file exists — no package creates it, they only ship a template to copy:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/.config/punktfunk
  # /usr/share/punktfunk/ on Fedora/Arch/Bazzite, /usr/share/punktfunk-host/ on Ubuntu
  cp /usr/share/punktfunk/host.env.example ~/.config/punktfunk/host.env
  systemctl --user restart punktfunk-host
  ```

  On Bazzite copy `host.env.bazzite` instead of `host.env.example`.
- **`status=203/EXEC`** instead means the unit that ran points at a binary that isn't there —
  usually an old hand-copied unit in `~/.config/systemd/user/` shadowing the packaged one and still
  aimed at a source checkout. Remove it, run `systemctl --user daemon-reload`, and start the
  packaged unit — see [Running as a
  Service](/docs/running-as-a-service#a-a-desktop-you-log-into).

## The host is asleep and won't wake

Clients wake a saved host by themselves — auto-wake is on by default — but only once they have seen
it awake, which is how they learn its MAC address, and only if the machine is armed to answer a magic
packet. The arming is what's usually missing, and a **Linux** host tells you outright: search the web
console's **Logs** page for `Wake-on-` — `Wake-on-LAN` for a wired card, `Wake-on-WLAN` for a Wi-Fi
one — and the line either confirms the card is armed or names the interface and the exact command to
arm it. A Wi-Fi card is armed by a different command than a wired one, and the log line gives the
right one. Windows and macOS hosts don't run that check, so go straight to the BIOS/UEFI and
network-card steps in [Arming the machine](/docs/wake-on-lan#arming-the-machine).

## Video is slow to start, or fails across subnets

The native **data plane** (the raw UDP that carries video, separate from the 9777 control plane) uses
a **random, per-session UDP port** — the host binds `0.0.0.0:0`, then tells the client which port it
got during the connect handshake. There is no fixed data port.

Video flows host → client, but the **client sends the first packet**: a small *hole-punch* datagram to
that port. This is deliberate. It lets the host learn the client's real (possibly NAT-translated)
source address and stream back to it, so a session can cross a NAT or a stateful inter-VLAN firewall
**without** a forwarded data port. What it means for a host firewall:

- **Same LAN, no host firewall (or the port allowed):** the punch arrives immediately and video starts
  at once. Nothing to configure.
- **Same LAN, host firewall that denies inbound** (ufw/nftables/firewalld default): the punch is
  dropped, so the host waits **~2.5 s**, then falls back to the address the client reported and streams
  anyway — a stateful firewall admits the return traffic because the host sent first. **Net effect: it
  works, but each session takes ~2.5 s longer to start.** That slow start is the symptom of a
  data-plane rule you're missing.
- **Across subnets / NAT:** the same punch-then-fallback applies, as long as the host's outbound video
  can reach the client (the path's stateful firewall then admits the return). If the host itself is
  behind NAT reached only via a forwarded control port, the data path may not establish — this is the
  case a fixed, forwardable data port would solve.

To remove the ~2.5 s fallback delay, **pin the data port** in [`host.env`](/docs/configuration) and
open exactly that one port. The punch then lands on a port your firewall lets through, so the host
answers it at once — no timeout to pay:

```ini
# ~/.config/punktfunk/host.env (Linux) · %ProgramData%\punktfunk\host.env (Windows)
PUNKTFUNK_DATA_PORT=9779
```

```sh
systemctl --user restart punktfunk-host    # pick the change up (Windows: punktfunk-host service restart)
sudo ufw allow 9779/udp                    # open exactly that one port
```

Running `serve` by hand instead? Pass `--data-port 9779` on that command line — but don't start one
alongside the service, which already holds these ports.

One caveat. A fixed data port serves **one session at a time**; a second concurrent session finds it
busy and transparently falls back to a random port (logged). Pinning changes nothing about how video
is addressed — the host still waits for the client's punch and answers whatever source it heard from,
which is what lets a forwarded port or a port proxy work behind the client's own NAT. On a normal
single-LAN setup you can also just leave the data port closed and accept the one-time ~2.5 s
punch-timeout, or not run a host firewall on a trusted LAN at all.

## `nvidia-smi` says it can't communicate with the driver

The NVIDIA kernel module didn't load. With **Secure Boot** enabled (`mokutil --sb-state`), the
module is signed with a locally generated key that must be enrolled once — or disable Secure Boot in
firmware, fine for a dedicated box. Import the key, reboot, and on the blue **MOK Manager** screen
(on the machine's own console, not over SSH) choose *Enroll MOK → Continue → Yes → (the password)
→ Reboot*:

```sh
sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der     # Ubuntu
sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub                # Debian (DKMS-built module)
sudo akmods --force && sudo mokutil --import /etc/pki/akmods/certs/public_key.der   # Fedora (akmod)
```

After a kernel update the module may need a rebuild — reinstall the driver package. Then confirm
`nvidia-smi` loads and `cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset` prints `Y` (Wayland needs
KMS; if it doesn't, `echo 'options nvidia-drm modeset=1' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-drm.conf`,
regenerate the initramfs, reboot).

## `systemctl --user status punktfunk-web`: unit not found

The web console is its own package, and the `punktfunk` RPM only *recommends* it
(`Recommends: punktfunk-web`) — a box with `install_weak_deps=False` in `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf`, a
`--setopt=install_weak_deps=0` install, or an `rpm-ostree` layering that drops weak deps gets the
host with no console and no unit to enable. Install it by name:

```sh
rpm -q punktfunk-web || sudo dnf install punktfunk-web punktfunk-scripting
systemctl --user enable --now punktfunk-web
journalctl --user -u punktfunk-web-init | sed -n 's/.*password generated: //p'
```

`No match for argument` instead means the repo you're on has no console: **COPR** builds host and
client only (its mock chroot has no `bun`). Use the RPM registry —
[Fedora](/docs/fedora#2-install-the-host), step 2. The same weak-dep miss happens on Debian/Ubuntu
after an `apt install --no-install-recommends`; the fix is `sudo apt install punktfunk-web`.

## pacman: error: could not register 'punktfunk' database (database already registered)

The repo block got appended to `/etc/pacman.conf` twice — the add line is an append, so running it
a second time leaves two `[punktfunk]` sections, and every later pacman run opens with this line.
It's harmless (pacman ignores the duplicate), but to silence it delete the extra block from
`/etc/pacman.conf`. (The [current add line](/docs/arch#2-install-the-host) checks first and won't
append a second copy.)

## The desktop won't start, or "GPU … not supported by EGL"

The NVIDIA **GL/EGL userspace** is missing — the base driver package doesn't always include it.

- **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install libnvidia-gl-<version>` (matching your driver).
- Confirm `/usr/share/glvnd/egl_vendor.d/10_nvidia.json` exists and `nvidia-drm modeset` is `Y`.

See [GNOME](/docs/gnome) for the GL/EGL userspace details.

## Black screen / no picture, but the client connects

- You must be on a **Wayland** session, not X11 (check the login-screen session picker).
- KWin must be **≥ 6.5.6** (`kwin_wayland --version`) for the *headless* appliance session
  (`kwin_wayland --virtual`); a normal Plasma 6 login needs no particular version, only the screencast
  grant. GNOME **≥ 48**; gamescope **≥ 3.16.22**. See [KDE](/docs/kde) for the KWin/Wayland
  requirement and [gamescope](/docs/gamescope) for the gamescope one.
- If [`host.env`](/docs/configuration) sets `PUNKTFUNK_COMPOSITOR`, **remove it** — the host
  auto-detects the live compositor, and the pin points it at one backend even when a different
  session is live (it also disables Gaming ↔ Desktop following).

## Games from my library open on a physical monitor, not on the stream (Hyprland / sway)

The stream shows your bare desktop while the game is running on a screen at the machine. On
**Hyprland** and **sway** the virtual display is an *extend* output — it's added beside your real
monitors, and neither compositor moves anything onto a new output by itself. Both open a new window on
whatever monitor holds **focus**, so a session that never claims focus launches everything onto the
monitor you were last using in person.

The host now claims focus for the streamed display at session start and again just before each library
launch, which is the fix — if you're seeing this, [update](/docs/updating) first, since hosts up to and
including **0.29.0** never claimed it at all. The host log says which head it took
(`focused the streamed headless output`), and warns when it couldn't.

If it still happens on a host that has the fix:

- **Are you also using the machine in person?** Focus is per-monitor and live: clicking on a physical
  monitor while the game is still starting pulls the new window over to it. Launch, then leave the
  host's own keyboard and mouse alone until the game is up.
- **A launcher that opens a second window later** (Steam Big Picture, Heroic, some emulator
  front-ends) places that window wherever focus is at *that* moment, not where the first one went. If
  this is your normal way to play, set **Virtual displays → Dedicated game sessions** to **Dedicated**
  — every launch then gets its own headless gamescope with only the game inside, and placement stops
  being a question of focus at all (needs `gamescope` installed).
- **Setting the topology to Primary won't do it.** Wayland has no primary output for these two
  backends to set, so Primary behaves as Extend and the host says so in the log. **Exclusive** *is*
  implemented here — it switches your physical monitors off for the session and back on afterwards,
  which does put every window on the stream. See
  [Virtual displays → Topology](/docs/virtual-displays#topology).

## The screen stays black after switching to Game Mode (Nobara)

On distros whose Game Mode is display-manager autologin under **plasmalogin** (Nobara), a managed
takeover from a host **0.19.1 or older** could kill the display manager: it trips systemd's start
limit and the box stays black until someone restarts it. Recover from a VT (Ctrl+Alt+F3) or SSH:

```sh
systemctl --user unmask --runtime 'gamescope-session-plus@*.service'
sudo systemctl reset-failed plasmalogin && sudo systemctl restart plasmalogin
```

Current hosts detect the display-manager flavor and never mask the session unit there — see
[gamescope → autologin display managers](/docs/gamescope) for the polkit rule that enables the full
managed takeover on these boxes (without it the host mirrors Game Mode instead).

## Game Mode: black screen on connect, or the stream is stuck at the box's resolution

You connect to a box that autologins into Steam **Gaming Mode** and get a black picture every time
— or a picture at the box's own resolution instead of the one your client asked for, with the box's
monitor still lit. Nothing errors: the client connects, the host logs no failure, no unit is failed.

The managed takeover is being refused and the host is falling back to mirroring the box's own
session. On a box whose panel is off (a headless appliance, a TV that's been switched away) there
is nothing to mirror, so the fallback is a black screen. Almost always the cause is **group
membership**: the takeover stops the display manager through a root helper, and that helper serves
members of the `punktfunk` group only.

```sh
id -nG | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -x punktfunk      # are you in it?
journalctl --user -u punktfunk-host | grep -iE "punktfunk. group|takeover unavailable"
```

The host also checks at startup on any box that will need the takeover, so a fresh
`systemctl --user restart punktfunk-host` puts the answer at the top of the log. The fix is one
command and a fresh login:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG punktfunk "$USER"   # then log out and back in
```

> **Read the reason the log quotes before doing anything else.** The takeover has three other ways
> to be refused — no packaged helper (a tarball or source install), no polkit on the box, and
> polkit denying the action — and the host now prints which one it hit, verbatim from the
> privileged path. Hosts up to 0.27.0 printed a fixed guess instead ("reinstall the punktfunk
> package, or install the display-manager polkit rule from the docs"), and on the group case both
> of those suggestions were dead ends: neither adds anyone to a group.

Two things this is *not*: it isn't the [pad group problem](#the-pad-works-but-arrives-as-an-xbox-360-controller-instead-of-a-steam-deck)
(same group, different symptom), and it isn't lingering — though a host with no login session of
its own enables lingering through the same helper, so an unjoined user often sees "enabling
lingering failed" first. Both are covered in
[gamescope → autologin display managers](/docs/gamescope#nobara-and-other-autologin-display-managers).

## Session fails right after editing host.env

- Keys are **case-sensitive**: `punktfunk_gamescope_attach=1` sets nothing — use the exact
  uppercase names.
- Hardcoded session anchors with the wrong uid (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000` when `id -u`
  isn't 1000) point the host at another user's PipeWire/D-Bus: audio errors like
  `pw audio connect … Creation failed`, no capture, and clients reporting the host as
  unreachable or asleep. **Delete both anchor lines** — a `systemctl --user` service doesn't need
  them — or fix the uid.
- `PUNKTFUNK_COMPOSITOR` pins the backend and disables Gaming ↔ Desktop following — remove it on
  any box that switches sessions.
- The env file is read at service start: `systemctl --user restart punktfunk-host` after edits.

## Capture fails: "Session creation inhibited" (GNOME)

A **locked** GNOME session blocks screen capture. On an always-on/headless host, disable the lock:

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled false
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0
```

See [GNOME → Headless session](/docs/gnome#headless-session) and
[Running as a Service](/docs/running-as-a-service).

## My mouse and keyboard are stuck in the stream

Nothing is broken — the stream captures them on purpose, from the moment it starts and again
whenever you click into it, so your keys and pointer go to the host instead of your own desktop.
**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q** hands them back (**⌃⌥⇧Q** on macOS), and with a pad in your hands
**L1+R1+Start+Select** does the same on the Linux, Windows and Steam Deck clients. Whatever you
were holding down is released on the host, so nothing sticks. The rest of the in-stream chords —
switch mouse mode, disconnect, fullscreen — are in
[Getting your input back](/docs/input#getting-your-input-back).

## My keyboard types the wrong characters (`#` comes out as `\`)

A German keyboard giving `\` for `#`, `'` for `ä` and `/` for `-`, or `z` and `y` swapped, is a
**host** layout mismatch — the client is fine.

Punktfunk sends the *physical key you pressed*, not the character, exactly as a keyboard plugged
into the host would. What that key finally types is decided by the layout the **host session** is
running, so the host has to be set to the same layout as the keyboard you're typing on. When it
isn't, every key whose position differs between the two layouts comes out as its neighbour.

On Linux, set the layout the normal way and reconnect:

```sh
sudo localectl set-x11-keymap de pc105 nodeadkeys   # your layout, model, variant
```

Punktfunk reads that setting and hands it to the session on the next connect. Two things are worth
knowing:

- **Wayland desktops don't read it by themselves.** `localectl` writes a file only Xorg opens, so
  before this release a correctly-configured box could still run a US session. If your compositor
  is already set to the right layout in its own settings, nothing changes.
- **Game Mode needs a current `punktfunk-gamescope`.** Gamescope publishes no keyboard layout at
  all to the apps it runs, so Steam and games saw US whatever the box was set to. Our build fixes
  that from `+pfhdr8` on — check with `punktfunk-gamescope --version`, and
  [update](/docs/updating) if it's older.

Nothing here changes which physical key does what in a game: `WASD` stays under the same fingers on
every layout.

## A controller is detected but games don't see it

- **Linux.** The host user needs to be in the `input` group. On Bazzite:

  ```sh
  ujust add-user-to-input-group
  ```

  Then log out and back in. On other distros this is `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` + re-login. See
  [Bazzite](/docs/bazzite).
- **Windows, if this PC ever ran 0.22.0 or 0.22.1.** On those two releases the default emulated
  controller bound one of Windows' own drivers instead of Punktfunk's, so the app responded to your
  controller normally but no game ever saw it. It's fixed from 0.22.2 on — but you have to update
  **through the installer**: the setup `.exe`, `winget upgrade`, or the console's **Update now**
  button (see [Updating](/docs/updating)). Swapping `punktfunk-host.exe` by hand does not fix it,
  because the stale controller device keeps the driver it was already bound to.

## The pad works, but arrives as an Xbox 360 controller instead of a Steam Deck

Only the **virtual Steam Deck controller** (paddles, trackpads, gyro) is missing here — ordinary
gamepad input is fine. That pad reaches games as a real USB device over usbip, and the sysfs files
it attaches through are owned by a group called `punktfunk`, separate from `input`. Four things
have to line up on the Linux host, and none of them announces itself when it doesn't:

```sh
getent group punktfunk                         # the group exists at all
id -nG | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -x punktfunk       # ...and you are in it
ls -l /sys/devices/platform/vhci_hcd.0/attach  # owned by punktfunk, mode 0660
lsmod | grep vhci_hcd                          # the transport module is loaded
```

If the group is missing entirely, the udev rule tried to `chgrp` to a group nobody created, so the
nodes stayed root-only. That was the case on installs that reached 0.25.0 by **upgrade** on Arch,
on NixOS, on the Bazzite sysext, and on Steam Deck source installs. Re-running your package
manager's upgrade (or `update.sh` on a Deck) creates it now; otherwise `sudo groupadd --system
punktfunk` by hand. Then `sudo usermod -aG punktfunk "$USER"` and **log out and back in** — group
changes only reach the host's `systemd --user` service on a fresh login, and on a Deck a reboot is
the reliable way to get one.

Joining the group is optional, and there is a real reason it is not automatic: writing that
`attach` file materialises an arbitrary emulated USB device. Skip it on a machine you share.

It is not only the pad, though: the same group authorizes the helper that stops the display manager
for a managed **Gaming Mode** takeover, so on a box that autologins into Game Mode, skipping it also
costs you [the takeover](#game-mode-black-screen-on-connect-or-the-stream-is-stuck-at-the-boxs-resolution).

## Stream lags, then freezes, with a DualSense pad (Bazzite, SELinux)

On Bazzite (and other SELinux-enforcing Fedora Atomic spins), a **DualSense / DualShock 4**-type
virtual pad can make the stream lag and then freeze — gamescope at 0 fps, `tx_mbps` collapsing —
measured live on Bazzite 43. The virtual pad binds the kernel's `hid-playstation` driver, and Valve's
`ds_inhibit` (inside `steamos-manager`) reacts to *any* such hidraw by walking `/proc/*/fd/` on every
open/close. SELinux denies `steamos_manager_t` that walk — **~324 `avc: denied` per second** — and
`setroubleshootd` amplifies the flood into a box-wide fork storm that starves the stream.

Two traps while diagnosing: the AVC lines read `comm="tokio-rt-worker"` — that is **steamos-manager,
not punktfunk** (check `scontext=…steamos_manager_t…`); and once started, the `setroubleshootd`
storm **outlives the denials by 15+ minutes**, so the box stays starved after the pad is gone.

- **Fix:** punktfunk ships a `dontaudit` SELinux drop-in that silences the flood (ds_inhibit then
  simply leaves the pad uninhibited — harmless). The sysext installs it on install/update; on an
  existing install run `sudo punktfunk-sysext reapply`. On a layered or bootc host:
  `sudo semodule -i /usr/share/punktfunk/selinux/punktfunk-ds-inhibit.cil` (remove with
  `sudo semodule -r punktfunk-ds-inhibit`).
- **Hardening, recommended on any streaming host:** `sudo systemctl mask --now setroubleshootd`.
  It is purely a desktop alert daemon — nothing depends on it (`systemctl list-dependencies
  --reverse setroubleshootd` returns only itself) — and masking it makes the box robust against
  *any* AVC burst. Reversible with `unmask`.
- **Workaround with a feature loss:** set the *client's* controller type to Xbox 360 (uinput, no
  `hid-playstation`) — costs adaptive triggers, lightbar and touchpad. The host-side
  `PUNKTFUNK_GAMEPAD` knob does **not** help: an explicit client choice outranks it.

## A Steam Controller 2 is captured, but Steam's controller list stays empty

The client says everything is fine — the Controllers screen shows **Steam Controller 2, captured,
streams as-is** — and on the host Steam's **Settings → Controller → Connected Controllers** has
nothing in it. Buttons do nothing in games, and the trackpads don't move the pointer.

Unlike every other pad Punktfunk presents, the Steam Controller 2 has exactly one consumer:
**Steam**. No kernel driver claims its product id — mainline `hid-steam` stops at the Deck — and its
state reports ride a vendor collection, so the pad produces no evdev node for anything else to read.
If Steam can't open its `hidraw` node, you don't get a degraded controller, you get no controller.

**On a Windows host, stop here — the rest of this section is Linux only.** Windows has no `udev`
and no permission gate to open: the pad is a UMDF device the `pf_gamepad` driver package serves, so
Steam reaches it as soon as the devnode enumerates. An empty controller list there means the driver
package is missing or stale instead. Reinstall it and reconnect:

```powershell
punktfunk-host.exe driver install --gamepad
```

The node is root-only until a udev rule says otherwise, and distro `steam-devices` rule sets are
per-product-id: a host whose copy predates the SC2 (it shipped in 2026) never grants it. Punktfunk
ships the rule itself from 0.30.0 on. On an older host, add it by hand:

```sh
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/61-punktfunk-sc2.rules >/dev/null <<'EOF'
KERNEL=="hidraw*", KERNELS=="*28DE:1302*", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", KERNELS=="*28DE:1304*", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"

EOF
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Then end the session and reconnect, so the pad re-enumerates under the new rule. `1302` is the wired
controller and `1304` the Puck dongle — the two identities the host presents.

To confirm this is what you're hitting, look at the host log for one line and one absence: the pad
attaching (`attached via usbip`), and **no** `answering feature GET` afterwards. That pair means the
kernel enumerated the controller and Steam never opened it. The everything-else checks — the
`punktfunk` group, `vhci_hcd`, the `attach` node — are in
[the virtual Steam Deck section](#the-pad-works-but-arrives-as-an-xbox-360-controller-instead-of-a-steam-deck)
above; if `attached via usbip` is missing from the log entirely, start there instead.

One more thing that is *not* a bug: with Punktfunk capturing, the trackpads stop working as a mouse
whenever Steam isn't running. Punktfunk turns the controller's built-in mouse-and-keyboard emulation
("lizard mode") off so it can read the full report stream, so on this pad Steam is what makes the
trackpads a pointer — exactly as on a Steam Deck in desktop mode.

## Copy and paste between host and client does nothing

The shared clipboard needs **two** separate switches on, and turning on only one looks exactly like
the feature not existing: the host operator has to allow it with `PUNKTFUNK_CLIPBOARD` in `host.env`
and restart the host, and you have to turn it on for that one host in your client's **Edit…** sheet.
Work through
[Why the toggle does nothing](/docs/clipboard#why-the-toggle-does-nothing-or-is-greyed-out) — it also
names the clients and host sessions where nothing crosses no matter what you set.

## A plugin's interface doesn't load

The plugin's page in the console opens — title, version, **Open in new tab** — but the panel below
it stays empty.

Plugin interfaces are served on **TCP 47993**, a separate port from the console's 47992, so that a
plugin can't act as you with your logged-in session (see
[Two ports, not one](/docs/web-console#two-ports-not-one)). An empty panel means the browser can't
load anything from that second port. Two reasons, in order of likelihood:

- **The port isn't open.** Only the console's port is reachable, so the frame has nothing to show.
  On a host you *upgraded*, this is the usual answer: an already-open firewall does not pick up a
  port that a later version added, because the rule it saved lists the ports it knew at the time.

  ```sh
  # ufw (CachyOS, Ubuntu): re-expand the profile, then reload
  sudo ufw app update punktfunk-web && sudo ufw reload

  # firewalld (Fedora, Bazzite, Nobara): re-read the shipped service definition
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

  ```powershell
  # Windows: re-run the service installer, which re-adds both console rules
  punktfunk-host service install
  ```

  Check what's actually open with `sudo ufw status verbose` or
  `sudo firewall-cmd --info-service=punktfunk-web` — you want **47993** listed next to 47992.
- **The certificate isn't trusted for that port yet.** Browsers keep a self-signed certificate
  exception *per port*, and a warning page can't be shown inside a panel. The console detects this
  and offers a link to open the plugin in its own tab: accept the warning there once and come back.

If the panel is empty and the console shows *no* explanation at all, the plugin's own port is
probably being dropped rather than refused — open 47993 as above.

## Pairing is rejected / the client can't connect

- The host **requires pairing** by default. Arm pairing from the web console, then enter the PIN on
  the client. See [Pairing & Trust](/docs/pairing).
- If you re-installed the host, its identity changed — re-pair the client.

## The picture freezes for a moment, over and over (Windows)

A freeze that comes back on a **rhythm** — every few seconds, every minute, always the same gap — is
not a bandwidth problem, and lowering the bitrate won't touch it. The Windows capture path detects
that pattern itself and writes the cause and the cure into the log.

Start on the **Status** page: while a session runs, its card shows **Capture health** — the
capturer's own verdict, refreshed twice a second. `healthy` and `idle` need no action (an idle
desktop composes nothing, and that is fine). `suspect` means the source stopped while the desktop
still shows signs of life; `stalled (worker)` / `(transport)` / `(conversion)` / `(presentation)`
names the leg that lost the frames, and **Last recovery** shows what the host did about it: the
stall class, each rung it ran with its outcome, and whether real frames came back. A `failed`
episode ends the video plane with a typed error and the session rebuilds its capture; repeated
failures back off (the cooldown is in the same block of `GET /api/v1/status`). Only when that
line does not explain the rhythm, go to the log:

Open the web console's **Logs** page and search for `METRONOMIC`. You'll get one of two lines:

- **…and coincide with Windows monitor hot-plug/re-enumeration events** — a display (or its
  cable, switch or AVR) is re-probing its link on a timer and Windows reacts every time. Cures,
  best first: turn that display's **auto input scan/detect** off in its own OSD (on TVs also
  *instant-on / quick-start* and CEC), unplug its cable at the GPU, fit an HPD-holding adapter or
  dummy plug, or simply keep the display active while you stream. The console's **Virtual displays**
  page also has a *Disable monitor devices while streaming (PnP)* toggle that suppresses the
  Windows-side reaction; the log line's `connected_inactive` field names the displays it suspects.
- **…with NO coinciding OS display event** — the disturbance is below Windows: a connected but
  sleeping screen being serviced by the GPU driver, display-poller software (the SteelSeries GG /
  SignalRGB class), or the desktop present clock — try a different refresh rate. On a laptop
  panel that the host deactivated, keeping it active with the **primary** topology usually
  settles it — see [Virtual displays → Topology](/docs/virtual-displays#topology). As a last
  resort, lowering the GPU-priority defaults (`setx /M PFVD_NO_RT_GPU 1` + a device restart, and
  `PUNKTFUNK_GPU_PRIORITY_CLASS=high`; the line's `rt_gpu_driver` / `rt_gpu_host` fields show
  what is engaged) has quieted this pattern on some AMD machines — but it masks the disturbance
  rather than fixing it, and costs stream latency under load.

Freezes that repeat *without* a steady rhythm are caught too: search the log for
`REPEATING without a stable period` — that warning carries the same fields and the same cure
list. Every session also stamps one `GPU-priority posture for this capture session` line near
its start, so a log shows the levers even before any stall fires.

## A browser animates at 60 fps, whatever the session rate (Hyprland)

The stream runs at the rate you set, but a page in Chromium or Firefox stays at 60 fps. Two separate
causes, neither of them the host.

**Chromium** takes its frame clock from the compositor's presentation feedback, and a Hyprland
virtual display reports the frame interval as unknown, so Chromium keeps its 60 Hz default. The cause
is in [aquamarine](https://github.com/hyprwm/aquamarine), Hyprland's backend library: a headless
output sends the present event without a refresh interval. On a 120 Hz virtual display a stock
aquamarine measures 59 fps and a patched one 120, so the fix belongs upstream.

**Firefox** does not adopt a Wayland output's refresh rate here at all, fixed compositor or not. Set
`layout.frame_rate` in `about:config` to the session's rate to lift it.

A physical monitor left on at a lower rate held Chromium at *that* rate in our tests, even on a fixed
compositor. Set **Virtual displays → Topology** to **Exclusive** to switch those heads off for the
session.

## Stutter, drops, or high latency

- Lower the **bitrate**. On a busy or Wi-Fi link, the requested bitrate may be too high — the native
  clients' [speed test](/docs/configuration#bitrate) picks a safe value; with Moonlight, set it
  manually.
- Prefer a **wired** connection or 5 GHz Wi-Fi between host and client.
- Streaming to **many devices at once** shares the GPU encoder. The host serves several
  concurrent native sessions (up to 4 by default); heavy load is usually bitrate-bound, so
  lower the bitrate first.

If the stream is *wrong* rather than late — a codec you didn't pick, 8-bit where you expected HDR,
4:2:0 where you asked for full chroma — the answer is usually that the host declined the request and
told your client so. [When the client and the host
disagree](/docs/client-settings#when-the-client-and-the-host-disagree) lists what it does with each
one.

## Audio stutters, and only the audio (Linux)

Video steady, sound broken up: on a Linux host, look for this line in the host log.

```
WARN  our audio capture group is being clocked by another node — every hole in this stream is
      that node's scheduling, not ours … driver="alsa_input.usb-…" expected="punktfunk-speaker-…"
```

PipeWire schedules audio in groups, and each group runs on one node's clock. The host brings its
own — the virtual output it records — so this warning means something has linked that output to
another device and handed it the clock instead. Whatever the named device does with its timing,
your stream now does too: if it stalls for 30 ms, so does the audio, and the host fills the hole
with silence.

The usual cause is a loopback from the host's virtual output to a real one (some "listen to this
device" setups create exactly that). The pathological case is a **sound card reached over the
network** — a controller forwarded with VirtualHere or USB/IP presents one, and its clock cannot be
recovered across the link at all; a host in that state synthesized 15 % of everything the user
heard. Remove the loopback, or turn off that card's audio profile (KDE → Audio → the device →
Profile → *Off*), and the group goes back to the host's own clock.

Without the warning, audio stutter is the same problem as any other stutter — see above.

## Streamed audio sounds worse than the host does

The host does not capture "the sound card" — it captures a **render endpoint**, and by default it
picks one that is *silent on the host* so the audio plays on your client only. On a PC with Steam
installed that silent endpoint is Steam's **Streaming Microphone**, which exists to carry remote
*voice*. If Windows has it configured as a narrow device — mono, or below 48 kHz — then the whole
desktop mix is squeezed through that before it is ever encoded, and no amount of bitrate will bring
it back.

Since 0.25 the host checks for this: it reads each candidate endpoint's real format, prefers a real
output device over a narrow virtual one, and says so in the log —

```
WARN  the desktop-audio loopback endpoint mixes at 24000 Hz, so the stream is band-limited …
INFO  audio loopback capturing device="…" engine_hz=48000 engine_ch=2 engine_bits=32
```

That `engine_*` line is the endpoint's **own** format, so it tells you directly whether the source
was ever full quality. To choose the routing yourself, set in `host.env`:

```ini
# client_only     — default; audio plays on the client only (a silent endpoint)
# host_and_client — capture a real output device; audio plays on BOTH ends
# follow_default  — capture whatever YOUR default playback device is, and never change it
PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_OUTPUT_MODE=host_and_client
```

`host_and_client` is also the quickest way to A/B the problem: if the stream sounds right that way
and wrong on the default, the endpoint was the cause.

Two related knobs:

```ini
PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_QUALITY=high    # low | standard | high (default high — stereo 256 kbps)
PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_REDUNDANCY=1    # force the loss-resilient audio plane on (default: automatic)
```

Both are a **request**, not a guarantee: the host budgets audio against the session's video
bitrate and steps it down on a narrow link, because audio is not managed by adaptive bitrate — so
whatever it takes is taken off the top. On a roomy link you get 256 kbps plus loss redundancy; as
the link narrows the host drops redundancy first, then the tier, and never goes below ~96 kbps. The
session log line says what it settled on:

```
INFO  punktfunk/1 audio streaming … tier=high kbps=512 redundancy=true
```

`standard` reproduces the pre-0.25 encoder exactly if you want to A/B it.

If what you want is **no lossy stage at all**, ask for it in the client: its audio-format setting
has a **Lossless** row per rate, and picking one is the whole opt-in. There is nothing to set on the
host — the host allows the lossless plane by default. If you want to forbid it on this host
regardless of what clients ask for, that is the same variable, inverted:

```ini
PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_HIRES=0         # refuse the lossless PCM audio plane (default: allowed)
```

The plane replaces Opus with uncompressed PCM — 44.1 through 176.4 kHz, 16 or 24-bit, stereo
through 7.1 — and it costs 1.4–8.5 Mbps in stereo (up to 33.9 for 176.4 kHz/24-bit 7.1) against
Opus's 256 kbps. Like every other audio setting here, that comes off the top of the link, where
adaptive bitrate can neither see it nor reclaim it. Which is why the client's setting ships off and
the host's affordability check is unconditional: a session only goes lossless when it can pay for
it out of a quarter of its video bitrate.

It is also unlikely to fix the problem *this* section is about: a lossless copy of a 24 kHz mono
mix is still a 24 kHz mono mix, so fix the endpoint first. What it buys is bit-exactness rather
than audibly better sound — on game content, 256 kbps Opus is already effectively transparent. On
Windows the host reads the endpoint's own engine rate (the `engine_hz` line above) and refuses to
pad, so 96 kHz means setting that device to 96 kHz in Windows' own sound properties. A Linux host
normally owns the sink applications play into and states its rate to the audio graph itself, so
96 kHz there needs no device configuration at all. Whenever any condition fails — the client didn't
ask, this host has `PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_HIRES=0`, the capture path can't genuinely deliver the rate, the
link can't spare it, or one frame of that format won't fit a datagram at that channel count — the
session quietly stays on Opus and the log says which one lost. That log line is worth knowing about
before you go looking in the UI: a declined session and a granted one look the same from the
settings screen, and the host's journal is where the reason lives.

One trap if the box you are editing is *also* a client: the Linux and Windows clients read a
`PUNKTFUNK_AUDIO_HIRES` of their own, with a richer grammar — a bare rate such as `96000`, or an
explicit `96000/24` — so one line in a shared environment sets both halves at once. **`0` is the
value that means *off* to each of them**, which is why the opt-out line above is written that way;
anything that isn't `0`/`false`/`off`/`no` reads as *allow* on the host side, so a client-shaped
`96000/24` also leaves the host's half permissive. The client's spellings are in
[Configuration → Client-side](/docs/configuration#client-side-native-clients).

## Audio lags behind the picture

The client buffers a little audio to absorb network jitter. Since 0.25 that buffer **corrects
itself**: if it drifts deeper — a Wi-Fi burst, a stall, or just the two devices' clocks running at
fractionally different speeds — it trims itself back a few milliseconds at a time, inaudibly.
Before, it could only grow, so a single hiccup left audio permanently behind the video and the only
cure was reconnecting.

If audio is still noticeably late:

- **Reconnect once.** It confirms whether the delay was accumulated (gone after a reconnect) or
  constant (something else).
- **Check for underruns** rather than guessing. The client logs its buffer depth periodically; a
  rising `underruns` count means the buffer is being starved, which is a network or CPU problem, not
  a buffering one.
- **Wired or 5 GHz Wi-Fi.** Arrival jitter is what the buffer exists to absorb; less jitter lets it
  run shallower.

## Windows: the host or the web console won't start

The **`PunktfunkHost` service** runs both halves of the Windows host: the streaming host itself and
the web console. It restarts either one automatically if it stops, so most console outages heal
themselves within a minute. The service commands need an **elevated** PowerShell or Command Prompt.

1. **Is the service running?**

   ```powershell
   punktfunk-host service status
   punktfunk-host service restart
   ```

   `restart` stops it, waits for it to actually reach *Stopped*, and starts it again.
2. **Two `punktfunk-host.exe` processes in Task Manager is normal — don't kill one.** The service
   itself runs as SYSTEM in session 0, where it can neither capture the screen nor inject input, so
   it launches a second copy into the interactive session and supervises it. One supervises, one
   streams.
3. **The console page never loads.** The service restarts the console on any failure, so give it a
   minute first. If it stays down, the console's own log says why — check
   `%ProgramData%\punktfunk\logs\web.log` (and `service.log` next to it, which records every console
   start and exit). Those files are readable only by Administrators and SYSTEM, so open them from an
   **elevated** PowerShell — `Get-Content -Tail 50 $env:ProgramData\punktfunk\logs\web.log` — then
   restart the service:

   ```powershell
   punktfunk-host service restart
   ```

   Right after a very first install the console can lag the host by a few seconds on purpose: it
   waits for the host to finish writing its certificate before serving.
4. **The status icon is missing after an update.** Windows only launches the tray at sign-in, and an
   upgrade closes the running ones. Put it back without signing out — from your **normal** (not
   elevated) shell, so it runs as you:

   ```powershell
   punktfunk-host tray start
   ```

   `punktfunk-host tray status` says whether one is running and where it is installed. See
   [Windows Host → Status tray](/docs/windows-host).

## Windows: "Punktfunk Virtual Display" shows Code 10 in Device Manager

Sessions end with *"pf-vdisplay driver interface not found"* and Device Manager shows the
**Punktfunk Virtual Display** device failed with **Code 10** (`STATUS_DEVICE_POWER_FAILURE`).
(Installs older than 0.22.2 spell that device name in lower case.)

This means your Windows version is too old. The virtual-display driver requires the **IddCx 1.10**
driver framework, which first shipped in **Windows 11 22H2 (build 22621)** — on Windows 10
(including LTSC) and Windows 11 21H2 the driver installs but cannot start. Reinstalling won't help;
the fix is updating to Windows 11 22H2 or newer. (Current installers refuse to run on older
Windows for this reason; if you see this, the host was likely installed with an older installer.)

## Still stuck?

Read the host's log around the failed connect or capture.

1. Open the web console's **Logs** page. It always holds the host's recent output at *debug* detail,
   whatever the log level is set to — there's nothing to switch on and no restart needed.
2. Filter it down to the level or the text you're after. The **Host / Plugins** switch beside the
   level buttons picks the producer: your [plugins](/docs/plugins) log to the same page, tagged
   `plugin:<name>`, so a misbehaving plugin is one click away rather than a separate hunt through
   the journal.
3. Use **Download logs** to save exactly what you're filtering on as a timestamped `.log` file you
   can attach to a bug report. The button beside it hands the same text to your phone or tablet's
   share sheet, or copies it to the clipboard on a desktop.

The same output also lands outside the console — on Linux in the journal
(`journalctl --user -u punktfunk-host`), on Windows in `%ProgramData%\punktfunk\logs\host.log` (plus
`service.log` for the service that supervises it). Those *do* follow the log level: raise it with
`RUST_LOG=debug` in [`host.env`](/docs/configuration) and restart the host. `RUST_LOG=info` is
already the default, so setting it changes nothing. The Windows files are readable only by
Administrators and SYSTEM — a normal editor is refused even on an admin account, because Windows
hands it a filtered token — so open them from an **elevated** PowerShell, or stay on the **Logs**
page above, which needs no elevation.

None of that covers the **client** side. If the picture, the decoder or the presenter is what
failed, the Windows client keeps its own log at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\punktfunk\logs\client.log` (rotated
to `.old` at the next start once it passes 10 MB, one generation kept) — that's the only place a
receive, decode or present failure is recorded.

For a performance problem rather than a failure, attach a **recording** instead of a log: see
[Recording a capture for a bug report](/docs/stats#recording-a-capture-for-a-bug-report).
