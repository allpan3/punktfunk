# punktfunk — an Omarchy shell plugin

Pair devices, watch sessions and control your [Punktfunk](https://punktfunk.com) host from the
Omarchy bar, without opening a browser.

- **bar-widget** — host state and live session count, with a badge when a device is waiting for
  approval. Click opens the panel; right-click opens the web console.
- **panel** — five tabs over a fixed header:
  - *Now* — who is streaming and at what, as a hero plus a two-column fact grid. Stop / End game.
  - *Pairing* — open a window, approve or deny the queue, type a Moonlight PIN.
  - *Devices* — both planes, access level, unpair on hover.
  - *Displays* — pick the virtual-display preset, and read the policy it puts in force.
  - *Stats* — the live stream, sparkline charts of how it is moving, and frame timings while a
    capture is recording.
- **service** — one long-lived event stream that drives both of the above. The pairing toast is
  the `pairing-pending` hook's (it carries Approve / Deny); the panel only updates its badge.

### Why tabs

Five subjects stacked in one column outgrew the popup: the sections at the bottom were reachable
only by growing the panel past the screen. Tabs make each subject's height independent, and they let
the one polling surface — *Stats* — run only while it is the thing being looked at.

## Install

The host package ships these files at `/usr/share/punktfunk/omarchy/plugin/`, and
[`punktfunk-omarchy setup`](https://punktfunk.com/docs/omarchy) offers to install them into
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/punktfunk` and enable the widget; `punktfunk-omarchy remove` reverses
both. Requires a Punktfunk host on the same machine — `punktfunk-host` on `PATH`. Omarchy 4.0 or
newer.

## How it talks to the host

Every call is `punktfunk-host ctl <verb> --json`, spawned as a process. **The QML never speaks
HTTPS, never holds the operator token, and never sees the host's certificate.**

That is a deliberate boundary, not an implementation detail. A shell plugin runs *unsandboxed
inside `omarchy-shell`*, and the management API's admin surface — the pending queue, the PIN,
unpair, session control — is exactly the surface worth protecting. So the credential stays where it
already lives: `punktfunk-host ctl` reads the operator token and the host's certificate from the
0700 config directory in its own process, pins the certificate **before** sending the token, and
prints JSON on stdout. If something that is not your host answers on the management port, `ctl`
exits 4 with no credential transmitted, and this plugin shows that state instead of a plausible
"host not running".

`Service.qml`'s `run()` is the only place anything is spawned. Reading it answers "can this plugin
leak a secret?" in about forty lines.

One process runs continuously: `ctl watch`, in `Service.qml`. Exactly one, because the host caps
concurrent event streams and the web console holds one of them. It reconnects by itself and emits a
`ctl.resync` line when it fell behind the host's catch-up ring, which is the plugin's cue to
re-snapshot rather than trust what it has.

### The one thing that polls

*Stats* has no event to listen to — the host publishes no periodic stats — so the panel polls
`ctl stats` every two seconds, and **only** while that tab is open. `ctl status --json` measures
116 ms on the Omarchy testbox, under the 150 ms threshold `ctl.rs` sets for itself. Everything else
is event-driven or refreshed when its tab is opened.

Nothing here arms a performance capture as a side effect of being read. Arming has consequences the
reader did not ask for: stopping writes a recording to disk, and the capture is a single host-wide
slot the web console also drives. It stays a button.

## Status

**Loaded and exercised on Omarchy 4.0.2** (Hyprland 0.56.2) on 2026-08-31, over a live 2414x1188@240
HEVC session: `omarchy plugin validate` passes, the shell loads it with no QML warnings, all five
tabs render, and *Stats* reads real encoder numbers off the running stream.

### What running it caught this time

- **A missing `open: root.opened` on the `KeyboardPanel` failed in total silence.** No QML warning,
  no log line — the panel simply never created its layer surface, while the bar icon kept working.
  If a panel stops opening and nothing is logged, check that binding first.
- **`displays` is always empty on Hyprland.** See *Displays* below.
- **Three numbers that were misleading until real data landed on them** — the encoder target read as
  throughput, `fps` shown without `repeat_fps`, and stage percentiles in milliseconds. See *Stats*.

Three things the first on-glass run caught, all still true:

- **The manifest shape.** Omarchy uses `kinds: [...]` + `entryPoints: { … }`, and the entry-point
  key is camelCase (`barWidget`) while the kind is hyphenated (`bar-widget`). `omarchy plugin
  validate` catches this — run it before you trust an edit.
- **Quickshell's `Process` does not search `PATH`.** It reports "the binary could not be found" for
  a program that is on `PATH` and executable. Every spawn here goes through
  `sh -c 'exec "$@"' sh …`, which does the lookup without re-quoting our argv.
- **`parent.<property>` does not resolve inside `StdioCollector`.** Assign through an explicit `id`
  or the whole call chain silently returns nothing.

### Displays: presets, and no live list

The tab picks the virtual-display preset and shows the policy it puts in force. It deliberately does
**not** list live virtual displays, because on this compositor there are never any to list: a
wlroots capture arrives over a sandboxed portal handle the host cannot re-open per attach, so
`vdisplay::registry` passes those displays through rather than owning them, and `/display/state`
comes back empty. Measured here against a screen you can point at — a live 2414x1188@240 head,
`displays: []`. A "live displays" section would have been a permanent "none".

The same limit is why the tab says a display cannot outlive a disconnect under Hyprland: several
preset summaries promise exactly that, and this compositor cannot deliver it. The other axes —
topology, identity, mode-conflict, layout — do apply.

### Stats: two numbers that are not the same number

- **Target** is the encoder bitrate, where adaptive bitrate has settled. Always available.
- **Sent** is what actually left the box. Only while a capture is recording.

Each is drawn as a sparkline as well as a figure, because one number cannot tell a bitrate that has
sat at 300 from one that just collapsed to it — and that difference is the reason to open the tab.
The window is client-side: the panel keeps what its own two-second poll saw, rather than shipping
the capture's whole time-series through a process spawn on every tick. It fills while you watch,
holds about three minutes, and is cleared when a session ends so a chart never draws a line between
two unrelated streams. Each chart's label carries its current value, so the charts replace the
numeric read-outs rather than repeating them.

Target and Sent differ by an order of magnitude on a still screen (300 Mbps against 11), because
capture is damage-driven. For the same reason the tab shows **new** frames per second beside
**repeated** ones: a healthy 240 Hz stream of a motionless desktop reads `0.0 fps new · 157.2 fps
repeated`, and showing only the first number would report a dead stream. Stage percentiles switch
between µs and ms at 1 ms — measured, `send` sits at 15 µs and `encode` at 2321 µs, and either
single unit loses one end of that range.

### Known limitation: one watcher per monitor

A bar-widget is instantiated once per output, so a two-monitor box runs two `ctl watch` streams
rather than the one this is designed around. The host caps concurrent event streams at 32 and the
web console holds one, so this is comfortably within budget for any realistic desktop — but it is
not what the code says it does, and folding the watcher into a shared singleton is the fix if it
ever matters.

## Reversing it

```sh
omarchy plugin remove punktfunk
```

The plugin owns no state — it stores nothing, and removing it changes nothing about your host, your
pairings or your firewall.

## Licence

MIT OR Apache-2.0, same as Punktfunk.
