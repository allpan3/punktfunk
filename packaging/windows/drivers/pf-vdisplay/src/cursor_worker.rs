//! IddCx hardware-cursor worker (proto v5, remote-desktop-sweep M2c).
//!
//! When the host ADDs a monitor with `hw_cursor` set and delivers a [`CursorShm`] section
//! (`IOCTL_SET_CURSOR_CHANNEL`), we declare a hardware cursor to the OS
//! (`IddCxMonitorSetupHardwareCursor`) — DWM then EXCLUDES the pointer from the desktop image
//! it renders into our swap-chain and instead signals our event on every cursor change. This
//! worker thread drains those signals (`IddCxMonitorQueryHardwareCursor`) and seqlock-publishes
//! shape + position + visibility into the host-created section; the host polls it at its
//! encode-tick pace (no event crosses the process boundary).
//!
//! Coordinates are published VERBATIM in the OS's desktop space (`IDARG_OUT_QUERY_HWCURSOR::X/Y`
//! = the shape's top-left, can be negative); the host subtracts its monitor's desktop origin.
//! Shape pixels are the OS's 32-bpp rows at `Pitch` — BGRA for ALPHA cursors, color+mask for
//! MASKED_COLOR — copied raw; the host converts.
//!
//! The same publish also lands in the monitor's [`CursorCell`] as frame-relative RGBA, which
//! the encode pool blends into its slots when the client draws no pointer.
