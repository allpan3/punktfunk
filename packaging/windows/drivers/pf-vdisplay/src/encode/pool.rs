//! The pool: three slots per monitor in the opened backend's input format, filled by the drain
//! worker's fused pass ([`Pool::offer`]) inside the acquire window and drained by the encode
//! thread. The monitor owns it, not the session: between sessions the newest frame keeps
//! landing in it, so a new `SET_ENCODE` on an idle desktop encodes the retained slot as its
//! first IDR and needs no compose. A pool built for another device epoch, size or format is
//! replaced by the next session; nothing rebuilds in place.
//!
//! [`Attached`] is the drain worker's cached view of the monitor's pool and session,
//! re-read only when `Monitor::encode_gen` moved, so the steady state takes no lock. It also
//! carries [`Cadence`], the compose-cadence histogram both modes stamp after `Finished`.
//!
//! [`bypass_enabled`] is spike S6 (design §3): no fused pass at all — the encoder reads the
//! acquired surface and the drain worker holds `FinishedProcessingFrame` until the AU is out.
