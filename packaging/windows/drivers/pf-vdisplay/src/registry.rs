//! The live-monitor registry: the one strong owner of every [`Monitor`], plus the per-id and
//! per-target state that must outlive any single monitor generation.
//!
//! A process `static` by necessity: the IddCx monitor/mode DDIs receive only an IddCx handle,
//! never the WDFDEVICE or its context. With one devnode and `ProcessSharingDisabled` the host
//! process dies with the device, so this is device-scoped already; device removal releases the
//! monitors' resources explicitly ([`crate::monitor::cleanup_for_device_removal`]).
//!
//! The lock is held for lookups and insert/remove only. A removal hands the `Arc<Monitor>`
//! back; the caller tears it down and departs it with the lock released, so nothing whose
//! `Drop` joins a thread or closes a handle ever drops under it. Lock order is
//! `REGISTRY → Monitor.*`; workers only touch their own monitor and never take this lock.
