# Punktfunk writing standards

House style for **commits**, **changelogs**, and **comments**.
`scripts/ci/check-writing.sh` fails a PR that breaks the caps below.

## 0. Where facts go

| Fact | Lives in |
| --- | --- |
| What changed, in one greppable line | Commit **subject** |
| Why it changed | Commit **body** (PR if it needs a diagram) |
| What a user can do now | `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` |
| What an embedder must do | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Investigation, measurements, rejected paths | Pull request and `docs/adr/` |
| Invariant that must remain true | Comment, type, or test |

---

## 1. Commits

```
type(scope): imperative summary

Why it failed for a user. What was actually wrong.
What you changed. Wrap at 72.

Fixes #123
```

- **50 characters** aim. **72 hard cap.** No trailing period.
- Imperative, present tense: `keep`, `skip`, `advertise`.
- One logical change. A subject with “and” or a semicolon is two commits.
- Body: at most three short paragraphs, **200 words**.
- Scope is a subsystem a newcomer greps: `host`, `hyprland`, `mdns`, `abr`, `console`,
  `gamestream`, `android`, `web`, `core`.
- No `Co-Authored-By`. Gitea 1.27 shows the trailer as a second committer. Credit in prose.
- Field logs, SKUs, soak minutes, rejected paths, RFC numbers: **PR body**, not the commit.

CI checks every commit on the PR: missing `type(scope):`, subject starting `The …`,
subject over 72 characters, body over 200 words, or a `Co-Authored-By` trailer fails the job.

| Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | User-visible capability that did not exist |
| `fix` | A bug. Put the symptom in the body |
| `docs` | Docs, comments-as-docs, release notes. No behaviour change |
| `refactor` | Same behaviour, different shape |
| `perf` | Same behaviour, cheaper. Name the metric if you have one |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `chore` | Deps, version bumps, generated files |
| `ci` | Pipelines and gates |
| `security` | Trust-boundary changes |

Bad: `The retry loop stops eating the restore that re-lights the desk`
Good: `fix(host/hyprland): keep topology restore across pipeline retries`

The Gitea PR title is the merge subject. Write it as the conventional subject.

## 2. Changelogs

Two audiences. Do not write both files in the same voice.

### `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` — people who stream

Existing template:

1. Compatibility line (plain language, no ABI numbers)
2. `## TL;DR` — three to six one-line bullets
3. `## Before you update` — only if the reader must act
4. `## New` / `## Improved` / `## Fixed` / `## Security`
5. `## For developers` — one link to CHANGELOG.md at the **tag**

Voice: `docs/releases/README.md`. Do not narrate a lab session. Say what the default is.

### `CHANGELOG.md` — embedders, packagers, plugin authors

Newest first. Version table (every row). Breaking changes with an action.
New sections only; do not edit older ones. User notes stay in `docs/releases/`.

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) categories:

```markdown
## [0.32.0] — 2026-08-27

ABI 25 → 26 (additive). Wire protocol stays 2.

### Breaking
- **Bitrate means the wire budget.** `live_bitrate` is no longer encoder rate.
  Embedders that treated it as encoder rate must stop.

### Added
- `punktfunk_connect_opts` replaces the `connect_ex*` ladder. Every `ex` remains.

### Fixed
- Automatic bitrate treated a still picture as congestion.

### Security
- Authenticated console sessions could reach pairing without the console password.
  Pairing grants launch. The routes now re-ask.
```

### Bullet shape

Two sentences per bullet.

1. What changed.
2. What the reader must do, if anything.

The bold lead is a noun or an API name.
Version-table Notes cells are one clause. If it needs a paragraph, it is a Breaking bullet.

Do not put in `CHANGELOG.md`:

- Metaphor
- Field measurements (SKU, soak minutes, underrun counts)
- Causation chains ("so… which means… because…")
- Why you did not take the other path
- Behaviour restorations under **Breaking** — those are **Fixed**

Those belong on the PR or in `docs/adr/` / `design/`. Link them.

### Length

| Release | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Patch | One screen |
| Minor | Two screens |
| Longer than that | Split, or link an ADR |
| Newest section (CI) | 160 lines (`scripts/ci/check-writing.sh`) |

Older sections are not counted.

## 3. Comments

A comment is the non-local reason: the trap, the lifetime, the unit on a magic number.
Names and types are the what. If the next five lines already say it, delete the comment.

### Voice

Present tense. The file as it is, for someone who has the code and not the git log.

Cover the next five lines with your hand. If the comment is only interesting as
history — how v2 scared us, a soak, a review ticket, a “this used to” — it belongs
on the PR or in `docs/adr/`. Keep the rule that is still true.

A comment is not a poem. No cadence, no punchline, no plot. Name the invariant
and stop.

A constant’s comment is why the number, not the incident that produced it.
A version comment is the live handshake, not a biography of every bump.

Bad (archaeology): `A v2 host never stamps the field, so a v3 driver would refuse
every attach — lockstep by the handshake, as ever. On-glass 2026-07-23…`
Good (the live rule): `A host that leaves this field zero fails the bind.`

Bad (field report): `Field 2026-08-28, iPad Pro / iOS 27 over Tailscale: …`
Good: `250 ms ≈ 30 refreshes at 120 Hz. A miss freezes the picture.`
Good (commit body / PR): the iPad, the log lines, the reconnect.

`// SAFETY:` is a proof, not how the bug was found. Dates, SKUs, and soak minutes
go stale; prefer a name (`stash_topology_restore_first_wins`) over a twelve-line
comment.

CI length caps are a backstop, not the style. A four-line war story is still wrong.

### Caps

- `//` : at most four lines (CI fails at six).
- `//!` / `///` module map: what it is, the contract, how to pin it, where evidence lives.
  8–20 lines (CI fails at 24).
- Swift has no `//!`, so a `.swift` file's OPENING `//` block is its module map and gets the
  same budget. Every comment below the header is on the `//` cap.
- Keep `// SAFETY:` and FFI/lifetime proofs exact.
- A comment never enforces a trust boundary — a type, a test or an assertion does.

CI counts comments this diff opened (the comment itself, or the comment above an item
whose body changed), in `.rs` and `.swift` alike. If it fails: shorten. Do not add `writing-ok` unless the extra
lines are a SAFETY/lifetime trap.

### When you touch a function, rewrite its comment

Do not sweep the file. Do not open a comments-only PR.

1. Restates the next five lines → delete.
2. Archaeology, field report, lab nickname (`ponytail:`), second copy of the commit body → delete.
3. Lifetime / weak-ref / generation-vs-session / why this number → keep, one to three lines.

### Module rustdoc

8–20 lines: what it is, the public contract, how to pin it, where evidence lives.
Point at `design/` / `docs/adr/`. Do not paste the investigation into `//!`.

### SAFETY

Keep proofs exact:

```rust
// SAFETY: the clipboard is open (the `Clip` guard); the handle returned is
// BORROWED from the clipboard and stays valid while it is open, so it is
// never freed here.
```

---

## 4. Error messages

Two registers. Pick by who reads the line, never by which language you are in.

### Operator register

`anyhow` context, `bail!`, `expect`, `panic!`, `tracing::error!` / `warn!`,
`#[error(…)]`.

A lowercase noun or verb phrase naming the operation that did not happen.
No `failed to` / `could not` / `unable to` prefix — the surface already frames
it as a failure and the chain then says so twice. No trailing period. API,
type and env-var names keep their own case.

```rust
.context("open {path}")?;
bail!("adapter exposes no {kind} decode profile");
```

Bad: `.context("Failed to open the config file")` — framing, no subject.

A `tracing` event is read on its own line, not appended to a chain, so it takes
the noun phrase instead of the bare operation: `"hook command did not launch"`,
`"client log upload failed"`, `"launch rejected"`. Put the cause in a field
(`error = %e`), not in the message.

Bad: `tracing::error!(error = %e, "launch the hook command")` — reads as an
instruction in the log.

### User register

The web console, the TUI, the tray, the setup wizard, every client app, and
every `api_error` string a client puts on screen.

Sentence case. One sentence saying what did not happen, in the words of
someone who streams games — no crate, symbol, protocol, hex code or errno
(`docs/releases/README.md` voice). Then, only when the reader can act, one
more sentence naming the move. No trailing period on a lone first sentence.

```
Couldn't reach the host — it may be asleep.
Check its power settings, then try again.
```

Bad: `Error: mgmt API request failed (os error 61)`

### Both registers

- Append the cause once, after ` — ` in prose or `: ` in the operator
  register. Never both, never twice.
- `Couldn't`, `can't`. Not `Could not`, `cannot`, `unable to`, `failed to`.
- Name the subject the reader knows — `the client key`, not `SecItemAdd`.
- Never a bare code, errno or enum discriminant with no words around it.
- No apology, no exclamation mark, no `Oops`, no `Please`.

A message that only a maintainer can act on is operator register, whatever
window it renders in.

- [ ] One logical change; no “and” holding two fixes together
- [ ] User-facing fact updated in `docs/releases/` or the docs-site page that owns it
- [ ] Embedder-facing fact is a bullet in CHANGELOG.md, not a new chapter
- [ ] New comments state an invariant or a trap, not a recap of the diff
- [ ] Comments are present-tense live rules, not archaeology or a poem
- [ ] Module rustdoc still fits on one screen (CI fails a touched `//!` / `///` at 24 lines)
- [ ] Touched `//` blocks are at most four lines (CI fails at six), except SAFETY proofs
- [ ] No new comment that is the only enforcement of a trust boundary
- [ ] New error messages pick a register: operator lines are lowercase phrases,
      user lines are one plain sentence with the next move
- [ ] No `failed to` / `could not` / `unable to` framing, and no doubled cause
- [ ] `scripts/ci/check-writing.sh` is green

## 6. Adoption

Do not rewrite old `CHANGELOG.md` sections. Do not sweep existing module rustdoc.
New sections and files follow this file. Rewrite a comment when you already open that function.

This document does not replace `docs/releases/README.md`.
