 * Derive a JSON Schema for a config schema, for the console's generic settings form.

 * Returns `null` when derivation isn't possible, which the console reads as "render the raw JSON

 *
 * Authoring rules, verified against effect 4.0.0-beta.99 and pinned by
 * `test/library-config.test.ts` — if an effect upgrade changes any of them, that test fails:
 *
 * * Use `Schema.Finite` / `Schema.Int`, **never `Schema.Number`** — Number's *encoded* form admits
 *   the strings `"NaN"`/`"Infinity"`/`"-Infinity"`, so it derives a four-way `anyOf` that no sane
 *   form can render as a number input.
 * * A decoding default is an **Effect**: `withDecodingDefaultKey(Effect.succeed(true), …)`. Passing
 *   a bare thunk (`() => true`) still derives a schema and still type-checks, then dies at DECODE
 *   time with "Not a valid effect" — deriving is not evidence that the schema works.
 * * Annotate every field: `.annotate({ title, description, default })`. The derivation does NOT
 *   infer `default` from `withDecodingDefaultKey`, so an un-annotated field shows no placeholder.
 * * A *checked* schema (`Schema.Int`, or anything with `.check(...)`) nests its annotations and
 *   constraints under `allOf`, so a form must merge those branches, not read only the top level.
 * * `Schema.Literals([...])` derives a clean `enum` — prefer it over a union of strings. A union of
 *   non-literals derives an `anyOf`, which is the JSON-editor fallback case.
 * * Fields carrying `withDecodingDefaultKey(..., { encodingStrategy: "omit" })` correctly drop out
 *   of `required`, which is what keeps the raw file free of baked-in defaults.
