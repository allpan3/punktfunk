// user profile: HKCU is not the operator's hive there, it is LocalService's own — so a plugin that
// read HKCU would silently see an empty registry rather than the user's launcher config. Every
// launcher fact a scanner needs (Steam's InstallPath, GOG's game list) lives under HKLM
// `WOW6432Node` anyway. Asking for HKCU is a bug, so this refuses it outright.
