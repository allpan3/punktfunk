// What a user typed into an add-or-edit-host form, and the one set of rules for turning it into a
// stored record.
//
// Three forms take this input — the pointer sheet, the gamepad screen, and the tvOS commit path —
// and each validated it differently: the same typed port became 65535 in one, the default in
// another, and a refusal in the third, so the same typo saved three different records. The rules
// live here so every form answers the same way, and so they can be tested without a view.
