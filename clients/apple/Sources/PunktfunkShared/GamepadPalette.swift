// The gamepad UI's background colour families, and the ink each one calls for.
//
// A palette is a short ordered ramp of DISTINCT hues, not one hue at several brightnesses. The
// 4×4 mesh samples that ramp diagonally with a per-cell offset (`cellRamp`), so neighbouring
// cells land on different parts of it and the colours pool and swirl the way a real gradient
// poster does; the mesh's existing control-point drift then moves those pools around. An earlier
// version rotated ONE field's hue per palette, which is why every non-default palette read flat.
//
// A palette also owns the UI sitting on it: `accent` is the focus wash / selected pill / switch
// colour, and `light` flips the ink so a pale field gets dark text instead of white.
//
// The table, `ramp` and `cellRamp` are mirrored in `pf-console-ui`'s `library.rs` (Rust) and the
// Android client's `GamepadPalette.kt` (Kotlin) under the same ids, so one `ui_palette` value is
// one look on every client. Keep the three copies in step: a palette added here without the
// others is a value the other clients silently render as Violet.
//
// It lives in PunktfunkShared rather than next to the views because that is the target the tests
// can reach — the arithmetic below is the part that has to agree across three languages.
