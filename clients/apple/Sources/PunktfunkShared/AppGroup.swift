// The App-Group foundation shared by the app and its extensions (Widgets / Live Activity).

// PunktfunkShared is deliberately dependency-free: it never links PunktfunkKit, which would drag
// in the Rust staticlib and the presentation layer. A widget process gets ~30 MB, so everything an
// extension needs — the stored-host model and its JSON codec, the settings-key names, the deep-link
// grammar, the Live Activity attributes — lives here and here only. (A few files import SwiftUI for
// a Color or an AppIntent; none import PunktfunkKit.)
