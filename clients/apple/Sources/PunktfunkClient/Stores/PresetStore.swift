// The settings-preset catalog as an observable store — the app-side wrapper around
// `PresetCatalog` (design/client-settings-profiles.md §4.2), matching what `HostStore` is to
// `[StoredHost]`.
//
// The catalog lives in the App Group suite beside the saved hosts, because that is where the
// things that POINT at it live: a binding is `StoredHost.presetID` and a pin is an entry in
// `StoredHost.pinnedPresetIDs`. Nothing here is keyed by host — "Work" applied to three hosts is
// one preset, and the per-host part is only the binding (§4.1).
