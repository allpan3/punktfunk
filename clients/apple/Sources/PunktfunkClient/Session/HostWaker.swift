// Wake a sleeping host and WAIT for it to come back before proceeding.
//
// A magic packet is fire-and-forget, and a cold box can take 20–60 s to POST, boot, and start
// answering again — far longer than a connect attempt will sit. The old path fired a packet and
// immediately dialed, so a genuinely-asleep host just failed. This drives a visible "Waking…"
// state instead: it polls `isOnline` about once a second, (re-)sends the packet while that stays
// false, and on success runs `onOnline` (the real connect for a Wake-&-Connect, or nothing for an
// explicit wake-only); on timeout it parks in a retry/cancel state. One wake at a time.
//
// `isOnline` is async because the only trustworthy answer costs a round trip: mDNS presence is a
// cache a sleeping host keeps warm for up to 75 minutes, so waiting on it both returned true for a
// host that never woke and never returned true for a routed host that does not advertise at all.
