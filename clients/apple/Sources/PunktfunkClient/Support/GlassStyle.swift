// GlassStyle.swift — the app's single, availability-gated entry point to Apple's "Liquid
// Glass" (iOS / macOS / tvOS 26). Every Liquid Glass symbol (glassEffect, Glass, the
// .glassProminent button style …) is HARD-gated to OS 26: referencing one with our
// deployment targets (macOS 14 / iOS 17 / tvOS 17) is a COMPILE error, not a silent no-op,
// unless it sits behind `if #available`. So all glass in the app routes through the two
// helpers below, each of which falls back to the EXACT look the app shipped before
// (.regularMaterial / .borderedProminent) — nothing regresses on older OSes, and the gating
// lives in exactly one file.

/// fills its panels with — so switching the background palette recolours the surfaces, not just
/// the text on them. The wash alphas are tune-on-device values with one fixed direction: the
/// pale palettes' white frost needs MORE body than the dark glass (the console's 0.66-vs-0.62
/// pair), because a thin white wash over a colourful field reads as haze, not as a surface.
