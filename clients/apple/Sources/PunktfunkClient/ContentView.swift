// the PIN pairing ceremony (verifies both sides at once), or — for a host that requires pairing —
// delegated approval ("Request Access": a plain identified connect the host parks until the operator
// approves this device in its console, no PIN). Once pinned, reconnects are silent and a changed
// host identity refuses to connect.
