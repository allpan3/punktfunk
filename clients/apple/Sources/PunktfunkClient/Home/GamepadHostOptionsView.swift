// A saved host's own actions — Wake, Copy link, Edit…, Forget pairing, Remove — reached with UP on
// its carousel tile. The console's answer to the overflow menu the touch grid hangs off every host
// card (HostCardView's context menu), and the Apple port of `pf-console-ui`'s HostOptionsScreen.
//
// Until now the gamepad UI could add a host and connect to one, and that was all: a renamed machine
// or a host typed in with a fat-fingered address stayed wrong forever, because the only surface
// that could edit or remove one was the touch UI. The tile is where a host is, so the tile is where
// its actions belong.
//
// UP is the gesture because the carousel is horizontal — left/right are spoken for and up is free —
// and because the desktop console and the Android console already do exactly this, so the three are
// learned once. A pinned profile card offers only Unpin: it is a shortcut, not a second host, and
// offering to remove the host from it would blur precisely the distinction a pin exists to draw.
//
// Vocabulary note: this screen says "Forget pairing" and "Remove host" where the desktop console
// says one word, "Forget". The console has only the one action; Apple has both (HostCardView calls
// them `onForget` = drop the pinned fingerprint and `onRemove` = delete the record), and two
// different actions cannot share a name on the surface that offers both. The touch card's words
// win over the other consoles' here — a user meets both Apple surfaces, and only one of them is
// cross-platform.
