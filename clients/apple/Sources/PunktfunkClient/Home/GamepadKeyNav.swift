// Hardware-keyboard navigation for the library grid (iOS/iPadOS/macOS): arrows move,
// Return/Space activate, Esc backs out.
//
// Asked for by a field user on an iPad ("select games with keyboard arrows, enter to launch"). An
// iPad on a Magic Keyboard and a couch Mac are the same situation the console layout was built
// for — a screen driven from a distance with a fixed set of directional inputs — and the whole
// navigation model (a cursor, a confirm, a back) already exists here for the controller. A
// keyboard is just a third input onto it, alongside the pad poll and touch.
//
// tvOS is excluded: the focus engine already routes hardware-keyboard arrows into focus moves
// there, and these screens hand it navigation authority on purpose.
//
// The view must be FOCUSED to receive key presses, so this takes focus on appear. That is safe on
// exactly these screens because they have no system text fields to steal it from.
