// The one piece of gamepad-menu machinery shared by the host launcher (GamepadHomeView) and the
// library coverflow (LibraryCoverflowView): a horizontal, center-snapping carousel driven entirely
// by a controller (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) — or, on tvOS, by the NATIVE FOCUS ENGINE: every card is a
// focusable Button, so the Siri Remote and a game controller both navigate through the system
// (dpad/swipe moves focus, select activates, Menu backs out at the presentation level), and the
// cursor/scroll chase the focused card instead of the poll. The poll still runs on tvOS but
// carries ONLY the Y/X actions (library/settings) — buttons the focus engine has no concept of.
// The iOS/macOS poll-driven behavior is untouched by the tvOS mode.
//
// The scrolling is pure native SwiftUI — `.scrollTargetLayout()` + `.scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)`
// snap exactly one item to center, and symmetric `.safeAreaPadding(.horizontal)` (sized off the live
// container width, so it's correct in an iPad split view too) lets the first and last item reach the
// middle. The CALLER owns each card's look, including its own `.scrollTransition` — this component
// deliberately applies none, so a screen can chain the VisualEffect-only transition modifiers without
// the generic wrapper here pushing the type-checker onto an overload it can't satisfy.
//
// Navigation authority: an internal `cursor` (an index), NOT the scroll-position binding, is the
// source of truth for where the gamepad is. `.scrollPosition(id:)` is a two-way binding and the
// scroll view WRITES intermediate ids into it while a programmatic animation is in flight — so
// reading the "current" item back out of it to compute the next one desyncs badly on a fast held
// stick (each move reads a lagging value and the cursor stalls before the last item). Instead a move
// advances `cursor` synchronously and points the scroll view at `items[cursor]`; scroll read-back is
// only allowed to move the cursor when the gamepad hasn't driven recently (i.e. a touch drag).
//
// Feedback is dual-channel by design: `.sensoryFeedback` ticks the DEVICE Taptic engine (for a
// handheld/touch user) and `MenuHaptics` ticks the CONTROLLER (for a couch user holding the pad).
// Both fire on a move, on confirm, and — for a non-wrapping list — a duller bump plus a short visual
// recoil when a move is refused at either end.

/// How a card arrives when its strip does: turned away on the drum, small, low and invisible —

/// the left of the anchor hinge on their trailing edge and cards to its right on their leading
/// one, so the strip FANS OPEN from the cursor rather than sweeping past it; the anchor card
/// itself only grows, since it is already facing you. Each card carries its own delay (see
/// `entrance(_:)`) — that stagger is what makes the strip read as one gesture instead of a
/// simultaneous flash, and it is the same hinge language the coverflow's own recede speaks, so the
/// arrival and the scrolling feel like one object.
///
/// ⚠️ APPLY THIS UNDERNEATH THE CARD'S OWN `.scrollTransition`, never around it. A scroll
/// transition derives its phase from the geometry of the view it wraps, so an entrance layered
/// on the OUTSIDE moves the very thing the transition is measuring: every card read as far from
/// centre for the whole travel, its phase pinned at fully-receded, and the centred card only
/// collapsed into its focused look as the entrance ended — arriving as a jump. Underneath, the
/// transition measures a card that never moves and simply composes its own scale/rotation on top.
///
/// ⚠️ NO `rotation3DEffect` HERE, however much the drum language invites one. It was the cause of
/// the strip's "flash as the cards settle": a real 3D transform renders the card through an
/// offscreen layer, and a card carries translucent glass, which resolves differently in there —
/// so every card sat at the wrong fill for as long as the master animation ran and then snapped
/// to its true one in a SINGLE frame the moment SwiftUI dropped that layer.
///
/// Measured on an iPad Pro 13": the centred tile held #4a3d87 for twelve frames in which nothing
/// moved, then stepped to #423970 (−23 blue) in one. It is the ANIMATION ending, not the motion:
/// stretching the timeline from 1.02 s to 2.82 s moved the step from 0.70 s to 2.50 s after the
/// launcher appeared — the same 0.32 s before the end both times. Removing the rotation removed
/// the step outright; `compositingGroup()` above or below the transforms did nothing.
///
/// So the turn is PROJECTED instead: `cos(angle)` as a horizontal squeeze is exactly the
/// orthographic projection of a Y-axis rotation, hinged on the edge the card fans from. Affine,
/// so no offscreen pass and no layer to drop — and it reads as the same gesture, losing only the
/// perspective trapezoid, which at these card sizes was never what sold the motion.
