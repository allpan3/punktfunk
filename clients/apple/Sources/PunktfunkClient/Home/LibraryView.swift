// that has a library, with streaming the desktop as the card's menu action.
//
// Three behaviours here exist to make the round trip (browse → play → quit → browse) hold together,
// all from a 2026-08-16 field report: the catalog is cached so a sleeping host still shows its
// titles, opening the screen wakes that host so it is warm by the time one is picked, and the
// position in the grid survives the stream. Titles already running are marked and sorted first.
//
// Gated on the host being PAIRED — see `HomeView.hostCard` for why the pin is load-bearing
