// The gamepad library's GRID arrangement — the desktop console's grid (`screens/library.rs`),
// in SwiftUI: 2:3 poster cells in rows that scroll vertically behind a viewport (a move scrolls
// only as far as it must to keep the focused cell in view; a restored cursor is seated a third of
// the way down), the launcher rows sitting squarely above the game rows with a heading between. Every cell is equally readable (no coverflow recede); focus is a ×1.06 pop, an
// accent ring OUTSIDE the cover, and the shadow. The `Resume` badge keeps the coverflow's corner —
// the same badge in two different corners on two arrangements of the same shelf would read as
// two different badges.
//
// The cursor is `LibraryGridCursor` over ONE `LibraryGridShape` that this view builds from what
// it actually laid out (the column count is a render fact, published before navigation is
// allowed — a move that arrives before the first layout is declined rather than guessed). ◀▶
// walk the row and refuse at its true ends with a bump; ▲▼ change row carrying the remembered
// column; L1/R1 page three rows and land on the ends; ▲ from the TOP row hands the controller to
// the bar. The detail band, legend and backdrop are `LibraryConsoleView`'s.
//
// Sizing follows the desktop's `k`: cells are 150×225 design units, gap 16, margin 48, scaled by
// `min(width, height) / 800` clamped to 0.75…3, columns = what fits, clamped 2…8, and the columns
// then stretch to fill the field's width. A Deck-shaped window gets 7, an iPad in landscape 6–7,
// a phone in landscape 7, an Apple TV 8.
