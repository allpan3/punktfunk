// (`GET /api/v1/library`) — the same payload the web console's /library page renders — and what it
// currently has running (`GET /api/v1/status`), so a title the player can return to can be marked
// as such. Offered for a PAIRED host only: the fetch authenticates with the pinned identity.
//
// The management API serves HTTPS on a port distinct from the punktfunk/1 data plane (default
// 47990, also advertised in the host's mDNS `mgmt` TXT). A paired client is authorized for the
// read-only library route by its **mTLS certificate** — no bearer token. The host binds this read
// surface to the LAN by DEFAULT (the bearer-gated admin surface stays loopback-only), so a paired
// client browses a host's library with no operator step. This mirrors the GameEntry/Artwork/
// LaunchSpec schema in `crates/punktfunk-host/src/library.rs`.
