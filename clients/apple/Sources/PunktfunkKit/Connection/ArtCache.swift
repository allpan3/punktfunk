// On-disk cache for library cover art.
//
// Posters are the bulk of what the library screen transfers and they essentially never change, so
// re-fetching them on every visit is pure waste — the Windows client has cached them on disk for
// this reason and Apple did not. It matters more now that host art rides `MgmtTransport`: a cache
// hit costs no connection at all.
//
// Lives in the CACHES directory on purpose: every byte here is re-derivable from the host, so the
// system is welcome to evict it under storage pressure. Entries are keyed by the SHA-256 of the
// absolute URL, which covers both host-proxy paths and store CDN URLs without either colliding.
//
// Deliberately free of any Network.framework / PunktfunkCore dependency, so it can be unit-tested
// against a temporary directory.
