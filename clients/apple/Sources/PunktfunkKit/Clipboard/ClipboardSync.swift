// Shared clipboard, client half (design/clipboard-and-file-transfer.md §5.2). One implementation
// for macOS and iOS/iPadOS; everything that touches an actual pasteboard sits behind
// `ClipboardPasteboard`.
//
// Both directions are lazy:
//
// * **Local copy → host**: a changeCount poll announces the *format list* (`clipOffer`); the bytes
//   cross only when a host app pastes (a `.fetchRequest` event, answered from the live pasteboard
//   by `clipServe`).
// * **Host copy → local**: a `.remoteOffer` places a pasteboard item whose data provider fires only
//   when a local app actually pastes — the provider then pulls the bytes over a `clipFetch`.
//
// Password-manager respect: pasteboards marked `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` or
// `org.nspasteboard.TransientType` are never announced, never fetchable. Echo suppression: the
// changeCount of every write WE make is recorded so the announce poll skips it (§3.4).
//
// Phase 1 formats only (text / RTF / HTML / PNG / JPEG / GIF). Files ride Phase 2.
