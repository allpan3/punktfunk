// Finger touches → host mouse, for the touchscreen devices: a port of the Android client's
// touch gesture model (clients/android .../TouchInput.kt) so the two touch clients feel
// identical. Two mouse modes share one gesture vocabulary — tap = left click · two-finger
// tap = right click · two-finger drag = scroll · tap-then-press-and-drag OR press-and-hold =
// held left drag (text selection / window moves) · three-finger tap = cycles the stats overlay tiers
// (off → compact → normal → detailed, matching Android) · three-finger swipe up/down =
// summon/dismiss the local soft keyboard for typing on the host (`onKeyboardGesture`):
//
//  * trackpad (default): the cursor STAYS PUT on touch-down and moves by the finger's
//    relative delta with mild acceleration — swipe to nudge, lift and re-swipe to walk it
//    across, tap to click where it is. This is what makes the cursor reachable on a small
//    screen.
//  * pointer: the cursor jumps to the finger and follows it (absolute moves through the
//    aspect-fit letterbox) — direct pointing for desktop-style use.
//
// `touch` never reaches this type: `StreamLayerUIView` forwards those fingers as REAL wire
// touches (multi-touch passthrough) instead. `off` runs a second instance with no `send`.
