// "The audio output moved under us" — the one signal `SessionAudio` needs to survive a device
// change, and the one piece of it that can be tested without a stream.
//
// Split out of SessionAudio deliberately. An end-to-end test of the recovery needs a live session,
// which needs a host, and punktfunk-host does not build on macOS — so the wiring that matters most
// (is the observer actually installed? does the identity check let the notification through?) would
// otherwise ship unverified, and a silent failure in it costs the session ALL of its audio. On its
// own this can be pointed at the real hardware from a unit test: see AudioDeviceWatcherTests.
//
// What it does NOT own: anything with session semantics. The iOS route-change steer and the
// media-services-reset re-activation stay in SessionAudio, next to the AVAudioSession they act on.
