// MARK: - the ms ⇄ interleaved-sample conversion both the ring and the sync loop run on
//
// **Multiply first, divide last.** This is the whole of design/hi-res-audio.md §4.1, and it is the
// Swift half of the same fix core just took (`punktfunk_core::audio::ms_to_samples`). Both types
// below used to precompute `perMS = (rateHz / 1000) * channels` and express every figure they own
// as `ms * perMS`. That division happens FIRST, so 44 100 Hz became 44 samples per millisecond and
// every depth, target, shed threshold, hard cap, de-prime fuse and reported `bufferedMS`/`targetMS`
// came out **2.3 % low** — quietly, permanently, and in the one subsystem two previous programs
// spent their time making trustworthy. 48 000 and 96 000 were exact only because they happen to
// divide.
//
// Keeping `rateHz` and `channels` as the two numbers they are, and dividing last, is exact at every
// rate on the ladder (`pcm::rate_is_supported`: 44 100 / 48 000 / 88 200 / 96 000 / 176 400). It
// costs one integer division per conversion and buys three more rates.
//
// **Why `Int` is enough here, where core needed an explicit `u64`.** Core's conversions run against
// `usize`, which is 32 bits on some embedder targets, so they widen and saturate by hand. This
// package builds for macOS 14 / iOS 17 / tvOS 17 only (Package.swift) — arm64 and x86_64, where
// `Int` is 64-bit — and the largest product any caller can reach is the longest span this file
// names against the top of the ladder: `syncBackoffMaxMS` (480 000 ms) × 176 400 Hz × 8 ch =
// 6.8 × 10¹¹, forty bits, before the divide brings it back to 6.8 × 10⁸. That is five orders of
// magnitude inside `Int.max`. The samples → ms direction is the one that takes a caller-supplied
// count and is guarded, because Swift TRAPS on overflow rather than wrapping and that trap would
// land in a realtime render callback.

/// Interleaved samples per second at a negotiated layout — the denominator both conversions share.
/// `max(1)` on both: a degenerate layout must not divide by zero in a render callback.

/// client decoded it into `AudioPCM` — and then never read it. Video's `pts_ns`, by contrast, is
/// used end to end (`LatencyMeter` computes a true glass-to-glass `displayed + clockOffset − pts`
/// per presented frame). So audio free-ran at whatever depth its jitter ring happened to settle
/// at, video was presented on a wholly independent path, and nothing ever compared them: the A/V
/// offset was an accident of buffer depths. It moved whenever the ring ratcheted under underrun
/// pressure, and — the way this surfaced in the field — it got WORSE every time video got faster,
/// because a quicker decoder lowers the video leg while leaving the audio leg exactly where it was.
///
/// **Video is the master.** In a game streamer the video leg is the input-feel budget and must
/// never be inflated to satisfy the audio clock; audio tolerates small, crossfaded, rate-limited
/// corrections that are inaudible, and `AudioRing.shedOneFrame` already applies them. So audio
/// moves.
///
/// **Continuity outranks sync.** This type only ever PROPOSES a depth. `AudioRing` clamps the
/// proposal to its own underrun-driven floor (see `AudioRing.target`), so a link whose jitter
/// genuinely needs more buffer than the picture is away keeps its buffer and the residual is
