// The Steam Controller 2 read OUTSIDE a session, so the gamepad UI can be navigated with it.
//
// iOS only, and BLE only. macOS surfaces an SC2 to GameController on its own (`GamepadManager`'s
// shadow suppression exists for exactly that), so the console launcher is already navigable
// there; iOS surfaces nothing for it, which leaves an iPad user unable to reach the launcher
// with the only controller in the room. `Sc2Capture` cannot cover it — that one is built from a
// live `PunktfunkConnection` at stream start, so it does not exist until the session it is
// meant to launch is already running.
//
// One link, one pad, no wire: state reports are parsed to `Sc2Device.State` and kept in
// `snapshot` for `GamepadMenuInput`'s 60 Hz poll. Nothing here claims a wire slot, forwards a
// raw report, or writes to the pad beyond the link's own lizard-off keep-alive.
//
// `Sc2Capture` owns the hardware whenever a session captures it — two centrals subscribed to
// one peripheral would double-feed it — so `GamepadManager.holdSc2Hardware` stops this pad for
// the stream. Either handoff costs at most one 2 s re-acquisition poll.
//
// Threading matches `Sc2Capture`: reports arrive on the link queue, `snapshot` is read from the
// main actor, so the state sits behind a lock; the attach edge hops to main.
