// Captured Steam Controller 2 pads — the glue between a transport link and the punktfunk wire,
// modeled on Android's `Sc2Capture.kt` with Apple idioms per `GamepadCapture`.
//
// Two transports, exactly one live at a time (`startTransport`): `Sc2UsbLink` for wired pads or
// a Puck dongle (macOS only — IOKit HID is not available to apps on iOS), and `Sc2BleLink` for a
// directly-paired controller (iOS and macOS). USB wins when a pad is attached, because running
// both would double-feed a controller that is simultaneously charging and paired.
//
// One capture handles EVERY pad on the live transport. Each HID source — a USB collection (a
// Puck slot or a wired pad) or the one BLE link — gets its own `PadSource`: its own wire slot,
// typed-mirror diff state, IMU gate and pending wireless edge, keyed by the link's source id.
// A Puck hosting four powered-on pads therefore claims four wire slots, and the host mints four
// virtual controllers. The feedback plane stays a single sink: `onHidRaw` routes each host write
// to the source that claimed that wire index.
//
// - **Raw plane (the point):** every input report is forwarded byte-for-byte
//   (`PunktfunkConnection.sendHidReport` → the host's as-is virtual 28DE:1302 pad, which Steam
//   Input drives like the physical controller) — with ONE exception: `Sc2ImuGate` zeroes a
//   frozen (gyro-off) IMU block out of state reports, so a stale resting sample can't drive
//   Steam's desktop gyro-mouse (the cursor-fly the bench debugged 2026-06-08).
// - **Typed mirror:** buttons/sticks/triggers are ALSO diffed onto the ordinary per-transition
//   plane, so a host that degraded the kind still gets a playable controller. No rich
//   Motion/Touchpad is ever sent for an SC2 — its IMU rides inside the opaque raw report; the
//   capture never uses the motion plane.
// - **Local chords:** the exit chord, the stats chord and the quick-action ring are read off a
//   per-source HARDWARE mask, never the forwarded one, so no client-side gate can hide the way
//   out of a stream. What the ring consumes is held out of BOTH planes until it releases, and
//   while the ring owns the pad the host is sent neutral state at the same cadence rather than
//   nothing — a frozen last frame is a held sprint that survives the menu.
// - **Raw return:** the host's hidraw writes (Steam's 0x80 rumble outputs, lizard/IMU feature
//   settings) arrive via `GamepadFeedback`'s hidRaw sink → `onHidRaw` → the link, landing on the
//   real controller's motors/firmware.
//
// Each source's wire slot is claimed LAZILY on its first parsed state report (`GamepadArrival`
// pref 9 — `GamepadPref::SteamController2` — or pref 10 for a Puck slot, before any input; an
// idle radio and a dongle with no pad powered on both stay invisible to the host) and released
// on link drop / suspend / stop / Puck disconnect, so pad indices never leak. The index comes
// from `GamepadManager.reserveExternalPadIndex()` — the SAME lowest-free allocator the
// GameController slots use, so an SC2 and a GC pad can never collide.
//
// macOS DOES surface a captured pad to GameController (on-glass 2026-08-31, vendorName "Steam
// Controller Puck"), so without help the host is handed the same hardware twice. The answer is
// the per-plane source-drop (the DeviceGyro precedent), never a global "SC2 is active" flag —
// that design mutes every other pad's normal feed too. `syncShadowSuppression` drops the twin
// only while a slot is claimed, so a pad this capture cannot open keeps the ordinary path.
//
// Threading: reports arrive on the link's serial queue; the host's hidRaw replay arrives on
// the feedback drain thread; start/stop/suspend run on the main actor. All mutable state sits
// behind one lock (the Android port's slot-table contract); the pad-index reservation hops to
// the main actor, and a source's reports are dropped until its claim lands (a few frames at
// ~66 Hz — idempotent state, nothing missed).
