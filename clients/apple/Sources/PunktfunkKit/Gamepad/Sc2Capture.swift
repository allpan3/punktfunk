// One captured Steam Controller 2 — the glue between a transport link and the punktfunk wire,
// modeled on Android's `Sc2Capture.kt` with Apple idioms per `GamepadCapture`.
//
// Two transports, exactly one live at a time (`startTransport`): `Sc2UsbLink` for a wired pad or
// a Puck dongle (macOS only — IOKit HID is not available to apps on iOS), and `Sc2BleLink` for a
// directly-paired controller (iOS and macOS). USB wins when a pad is attached, because running
// both would double-feed a controller that is simultaneously charging and paired.
//
// - **Raw plane (the point):** every input report is forwarded byte-for-byte
//   (`PunktfunkConnection.sendHidReport` → the host's as-is virtual 28DE:1302 pad, which Steam
//   Input drives like the physical controller) — with ONE exception: `Sc2ImuGate` zeroes a
//   frozen (gyro-off) IMU block out of state reports, so a stale resting sample can't drive
//   Steam's desktop gyro-mouse (the cursor-fly the bench debugged 2026-06-08).
// - **Typed mirror:** buttons/sticks/triggers are ALSO diffed onto the ordinary per-transition
//   plane, so the emergency exit chord works, and a host that degraded the kind still gets a
//   playable controller. No rich Motion/Touchpad is ever sent for an SC2 — its IMU rides inside
//   the opaque raw report; the capture never uses the motion plane.
// - **Raw return:** the host's hidraw writes (Steam's 0x80 rumble outputs, lizard/IMU feature
//   settings) arrive via `GamepadFeedback`'s hidRaw sink → `onHidRaw` → the link, landing on the
//   real controller's motors/firmware.
//
// The wire slot is claimed LAZILY on the first parsed state report (`GamepadArrival` pref 9 —
// `GamepadPref::SteamController2` — or pref 10 for a Puck, before any input; an idle radio and a
// dongle with no pad powered on both stay invisible to the host) and released on link drop /
// suspend / stop / Puck disconnect, so pad indices never leak. The index comes
// from `GamepadManager.reserveExternalPadIndex()` — the SAME lowest-free allocator the
// GameController slots use, so an SC2 and a GC pad can never collide.
//
// No global "SC2 is active" suppression flag exists here (the obvious such design mutes ALL
// pads' normal feed — a known trap): on punktfunk there is no double feed by
// construction — GameController never surfaces the raw Valve device on Apple, and the BLE
// lizard-mode kb/mouse never produces gamepad events — so no suppression wiring exists here.
// If GameController ever does surface it, the designed-in idioms are the per-plane source-drop
// (the DeviceGyro precedent) and GamepadCapture's single computed `wire` nil-gate; wire one of
// those rather than resurrecting a global flag.
//
// Threading: BLE reports arrive on the link's serial queue; the host's hidRaw replay arrives on
// the feedback drain thread; start/stop/suspend run on the main actor. All mutable state sits
// behind one lock (the Android port's slot-table contract); the pad-index reservation hops to
// the main actor, and reports are dropped until the claim lands (a few frames at ~66 Hz —
// idempotent state, nothing missed).
