// The ink the console (gamepad) UI draws with under the chosen background palette.
//
// The console screens were white-on-dark throughout with the brand violet hardcoded as the accent.
// Both had to become palette-derived at once: a pale field needs dark text or it is unreadable,
// and a violet focus wash on a copper field is exactly the clash this exists to fix.
//
// Published as a CompositionLocal rather than passed down, so a leaf (a row, a hint pill, a card)
// can ask for the right colour without every caller in between knowing about palettes. The Apple
// client uses an environment value and `pf-console-ui` a thread-local for the same reason.
