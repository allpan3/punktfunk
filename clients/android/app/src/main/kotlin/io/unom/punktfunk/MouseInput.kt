 *
 * Android gives a mouse's consumer-page Back the same device shape as a remote's, so off a TV
 * nothing is guessed: the Back gesture, the twist and Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O open the ring, and every
 * external non-pad Back belongs to the host. On a TV the remote's Back is the way in, so only a
 * mouse with no D-pad claims it — an air-mouse remote keeps its Back.
 *
 * A side button the system maps to Back (One UI 8 does, with no setting) never reaches us as a
 * button: Android injects a Back key from a virtual device of its own, stamped like the nav
 * bar's. From Android 16 the Back gesture takes the predictive dispatch path and is no key at
 * all, so with a mouse attached a Back from no external device is the mouse's. Before that
 * ([gestureIsKey]) the gesture and the nav bar send that same key, and it stays the ring's.

 *    local cursor is hidden over the stream (StreamScreen sets a TYPE_NULL pointer icon); the
 *    host's own cursor, composited into the video, is the one you see.
 *  * **captured**: the OS pointer is grabbed ([android.view.View.requestPointerCapture]) and raw
 *    relative deltas forward as `MouseMove` — FPS mouse-look. Engaged at stream start / by
 *    clicking into the stream when the "Capture pointer for games" setting is on, and toggled
 *    any time by Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q (the cross-client chord). Focus loss releases it (the OS
 *    guarantees that); a click re-engages.
 *
 * Buttons ride [MotionEvent.ACTION_BUTTON_PRESS]/RELEASE edges (left/middle/right/back/forward →
 * wire 1/2/3/4/5), the wheel rides [MotionEvent.ACTION_SCROLL] through [ScrollNormalizer] — a
 * touchpad's measured distance goes out as Finger DIP, a detent-counted wheel as v120, and the
 * unsent fraction rides the normalizer so high-resolution wheels don't lose sub-notch travel.
 * Held buttons are tracked and flushed on capture loss / stream exit so nothing sticks on the
 * host. Events reach this class from MainActivity's dispatch overrides (uncaptured) and the
 * capture view's captured-pointer listener.
