/**
 * Android gamepad capture → punktfunk/1 gamepad wire (the `input.rs::gamepad` contract; the host
 * accumulates the incremental events into its virtual xpad). The Android analogue of the Linux
 * client's `gamepad.rs` (SDL3) and the Apple client's `GamepadCapture.swift` (GameController) — all
 * three emit byte-identical events. Single-pad model: exactly one controller forwarded as pad 0.
 *
 * Buttons arrive as KeyEvents (SOURCE_GAMEPAD); sticks/triggers/HAT arrive as joystick MotionEvents
 * (SOURCE_JOYSTICK, ACTION_MOVE). The D-pad is sent as BTN_DPAD_* buttons (no hat axis on the wire),
 * decomposed from either KEYCODE_DPAD_* (gamepad source) or AXIS_HAT_X/Y.
 *
 * Normalization (wire = XInput/Moonlight): sticks i16 ±32767 with **+y = up**; triggers 0..255.
 * Android AXIS_Y/AXIS_RZ are +y = down, so Y is negated. No deadzone here — the host/game owns it
 * (parity with the Linux/Apple clients).

     * to the system, and a FLAG_FALLBACK BACK is swallowed — which is what identifies this as the
     * cause of such a report without knowing the hardware.
     *
     * It also meant such a pad could not produce [BTN_BACK] at all, so every shortcut built on
     * Select — the emergency exit chord this client's own start banner advertises, the mic mute,
     * the stats tier — was unreachable on exactly the devices whose users have no keyboard.
     *
     * A pad that DOES carry `BUTTON_SELECT` is unaffected in both directions: it never had the
     * bug, and this changes nothing for it.
     *
     * FLAG_FALLBACK events are excluded: those are the synthetic BACK the framework raises after
     * an unconsumed `BUTTON_*` press (a pad reporting L2/R2 as keys, say), not a button anyone
     * touched, and forwarding one would put a phantom Select on the wire. `MainActivity` drops
     * them on the keycode path for the same reason.
     *
     * Callers must gate on `SOURCE_GAMEPAD` before asking, exactly as [buttonBit]'s `KEYCODE_DPAD_*`
     * rows require: a remote's or keyboard's BACK shares this keycode and has to keep leaving the

    // Android turns a pad's raw evdev scancode into a `KeyEvent.keyCode` through a KEY LAYOUT
    // file matched on USB VID/PID (`Vendor_054c_Product_0ce6.kl` & co.). A pad with no matching
    // file falls back to AOSP's `Generic.kl`, which assigns keycodes by SCANCODE POSITION —
    // `0x130`→BUTTON_A, `0x131`→BUTTON_B, `0x132`→BUTTON_C, and so on up. That is only right if
    // the pad's buttons happen to sit at the positions the file assumes, and a HID gamepad with
    // no kernel driver behind it numbers its buttons 1..n straight through IN ITS OWN REPORT
    // ORDER — so every keycode after the first divergence is somebody else's button.
    //
    // Reported from a Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2026-08-20): a DualSense and an Xbox Elite Series 2,
    // both over Bluetooth, both identified correctly but with buttons landing on the wrong
    // actions ("L1 being L2"). Neither has a layout there — AOSP ships none for the Elite
    // Series 2 over Bluetooth (`045e:0b05`) on ANY version, and the DualSense's
    // (`054c:0ce6`) both postdates Fire OS and carries `requires_kernel_config
    // CONFIG_HID_PLAYSTATION`, which a Fire TV kernel does not have. A DualSense reporting
    // straight through puts L2 on `0x136`, which `Generic.kl` calls BUTTON_L1: the reported
    // symptom exactly.
    //
    // The fix is to resolve buttons from the SCANCODE, which is the pad's own report position and
    // is immune to the layout file — the same reason [Keymap.toVk] reads `scanCode` for keyboards.
    // Two things keep it from breaking a pad that already works:
    //
    //  1. Nothing is corrected on a pad that names its triggers ([padButtons]). A descriptor
    //     well-formed enough to call them Accelerator/Brake puts its buttons at the standard
    //     positions too, and that is the fact — not the model — that separates the two firmwares
    //     of the SAME Xbox pad, only the older of which needs any of this.
    //  2. Past that gate the correction still applies ONLY where the delivered keycode is what
    //     `Generic.kl` would have said ([genericKeyCode]). A different keycode means a
    //     device-specific layout IS in force and knows this pad better than we do.
    //
    // Moonlight carries the same two tables AND the same gate (`ControllerHandler`'s
    // `isNonStandardDualShock4` / `isNonStandardXboxBtController`, the latter on `gasRange == null`),
    // which is why both pads work there on the same box.
    //
    // The first cut of this asked `hasKeys(BUTTON_C, BUTTON_Z)` on its own, on the reasoning that a
    // pad numbering straight through reaches keycodes no controller has a button for. It does — but
    // so does every pad that merely DECLARES six buttons, because `hid-input` allocates `BTN_A + n`
    // straight through for the whole descriptor whether or not the pad ever presses them. That fired
    // the correction on pads Android was already reading correctly (2026-08-21: an Xbox pad
    // answering X with Y, Y with LB, and both shoulders with a menu button), and it could not have
    // done otherwise: the signal is identical on the firmware that needs correcting and the one that
    // does not. Declaration is not report order. Only the axes tell them apart.
