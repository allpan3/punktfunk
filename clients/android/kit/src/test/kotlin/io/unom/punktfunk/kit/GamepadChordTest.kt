 * the shared edge rule both fire on. A [GamepadRouter] itself needs an InputManager, a main Looper
 * and live InputDevices behind it, so driving real KeyEvents through it is not a unit test; the
 * rule below is the whole of what those two `if`s decide.
 *
 * The Apple client pins the same chords from its own side (`GamepadStatsChordTests`), and the two
 * suites exist for the same reason: a chord that stops completing fails INVISIBLY — the buttons
 * still reach the game, nothing logs, and the couch simply finds that a shortcut it was told about
 * does nothing. On a TV the stats chord is the only route to the overlay at all.
