//! The ASurfaceControl present backend (default): MediaCodec → `AImageReader` → `ASurfaceControl`
//! transactions, scheduled against the panel's real present clock.
//!
//! Where the SurfaceView presenter ([`super::presenter`]) predicts SurfaceFlinger's latch off a
//! choreographer grid that Android down-rates for a game uid, this backend gets the truth: every
//! applied transaction reports its real latch time and the previous buffer's release fence on
//! completion ([`super::surface_control::PresentComplete`]). Those two facts are the whole point —
//! the panel period is learned from real latch spacings (no down-rate lie), the glass budget is
//! bounded by real completions (no mispredicted reopen backpressuring the codec), and the latch
//! metric is always available (not the best-effort `OnFrameRendered` the SurfaceView path leans on).
//!
//! Both present intents ride the one actuator — a desired present time on the transaction:
//!   * **latency** (default `present_priority`): newest-wins. Each pump drains the reader to the
//!     newest image (`acquireLatestImageAsync` drops the rest back to the pool) and presents it at
//!     the next real vsync. Minimal depth.
//!   * **smooth**: a small FIFO drained on each frame's [`CadenceClock`] due time — the source's own
//!     cadence, recovered from the wire pts, finally with a truthful present clock beneath it.
//!
//! Memory safety does NOT rest on the release fences: an `AImage` (and the `AHardwareBuffer` it
//! wraps) stays alive through SurfaceFlinger's own reference taken by `setBuffer`, so deleting our
//! handle early at worst reuses a buffer a touch soon (a visible tear), never a use-after-free. The
//! fences are the correctness of *timing*, not of memory — which is what lets this ship behind an
//! auto-fallback with the residual risk being visual, not a crash.
//!
//! **The acquire fence must come from `acquireNextImageAsync`, never `acquireLatestImageAsync`.**
//! `AImageReader::acquireLatestImage` (`NdkImageReader.cpp`, unfixed as of AOSP main) drains with
//! one `int*` out-param it overwrites per image, then releases each dropped image with whatever the
//! out-param currently holds — the *successor's* fence:
//!
//! ```text
//! acquireImageLocked(&prev, fd)  → *fd = F1        (prev = img1)
//! acquireImageLocked(&next, fd)  → *fd = F2        (next = img2; F1 overwritten and leaked)
//! prev->close(*fd)               → reader adopts F2 as img1's release fence, then closes it
//! acquireImageLocked(&next, fd)  → no buffer; leaves *fd alone
//! returns img2 with *fd = F2     ← already given away and closed
//! ```
//!
//! So the moment a burst gives it two images to collapse, the caller is handed a stale fd plus one
//! leaked fd per extra drop. Passing that stale fd to `setBuffer` transfers it to SurfaceFlinger,
//! which closes it again — an `fdsan` `SIGABRT` on the decode thread, either at `Fence::Fence(int)`
//! inside `setBuffer` (the number was already re-owned) or at the end of `Transaction::apply` when
//! the layer state is torn down. `AscBackend::drain_reader` therefore does newest-wins itself.
