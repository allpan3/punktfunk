//! Pad audio on Android (the 0xD1 plane) — tier A, WP9.
//!
//! The Android twin of [`pf_client_core::pad_audio`]: drain the host's per-pad DualSense streams,
//! Opus-decode haptics (kind 0) and speaker (kind 1), interleave them into the pad's own
//! 4-channel layout, and render them on the physical pad.
//!
//! # Why this needs a USB driver instead of an audio API
//!
//! Every other client hands the 4-channel stream to the platform's audio graph — WASAPI on
//! Windows, PipeWire on Linux, CoreAudio on Apple. **Android has no such option for this device.**
//! AOSP's `UsbAlsaManager` carries a hardcoded VID/PID denylist that includes the DualSense
//! (`054c:0ce6`), so the kernel enumerates the pad's playback node and the framework then discards
//! it: `hasOutput: false`. There is no `AudioDeviceInfo` for `setPreferredDevice` to target, and
//! `/dev/snd` is closed to apps by SELinux. Android's own `UsbRequest` API cannot help either — it
//! rejects any endpoint that is not bulk or interrupt.
//!
//! So this path drives the pad's isochronous endpoint directly, through `uac-host` on the file
//! descriptor Java already owns. That is measured, not hoped: on a Nothing Phone (3) the claim
//! succeeds unprivileged, the gamepad and the pad's microphone both keep working, and the
//! underrun-free floor is **4 ms in flight** — including under eight-core load with the SoC in
//! severe thermal throttling.
//!
//! # The exclusivity that shapes everything here, and what is actually known about it
//!
//! `valid_flag0` bit 1 (`HAPTICS_SELECT`) disables the audio-haptics path, and every rumble write
//! that exists — `hid-playstation`, SDL, and our own [`crate::feedback`] path via `DsDevice` —
//! asserts it. So haptics and classic rumble cannot both drive the coils **as coded**, and the
//! arbitration selects rather than blends.
//!
//! What is NOT established is the stronger claim this module used to make: that the coils and the
//! rumble motors are the same physical actuators, exclusive *in the firmware*. No teardown, vendor
//! document or measurement supports it here; it traces to one reverse-engineered comment in SDL,
//! and SDL's own modern path sets `HAPTICS_SELECT` **alone** (amplitude rides `ucEnableBits3`),
//! which reads more like an independent mute for the audio path than a shared-actuator interlock.
//! The combination that would settle it — rumble asserted with `HAPTICS_SELECT` CLEARED — is
//! emitted by no code anywhere, so nothing here writes it either.
//!
//! The arbitration is therefore built on **evidence, not prediction**: haptics owns the coils only
//! while haptics frames are actually arriving (see [`haptics_owns_coils`]). That is correct under
//! either hypothesis, and it is what keeps a rumble-only title rumbling — it renders no haptics
//! audio, the host's silence gate emits nothing, and the pad simply keeps its motors.
