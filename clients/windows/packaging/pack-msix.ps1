.SYNOPSIS
  Assemble, pack and sign the punktfunk Windows client as a signed MSIX.

.DESCRIPTION
  Builds a packaging layout from a release `cargo build` output (exe + the reactor/SDL3 auto-staged
  DLLs + resources.pri + the checked-in Assets + the manifest), runs makeappx, and
  signs with signtool. Idempotent; safe to re-run.

  NO FFmpeg DLLs since M10 (design/client-native-decode.md §6): the client decodes natively
  (pf-vkdecode / pf-dxvadec / openh264+rav1d) and link-imports no libav* at all, so the
  wildcard copy and its LGPL notice are gone with it. The HOST installer is unchanged —
  packaging/windows/pack-host-installer.ps1 still ships them for its amf-qsv encode path.

  Signing cert precedence:
    0. Azure Artifact Signing (formerly Trusted Signing) when AZURE_CODESIGNING_ENDPOINT/_ACCOUNT/
       _PROFILE are all set. HSM-backed, so there is no .pfx and nothing to export: the chain is
       publicly trusted, so no .cer is produced and MSIX_CER_PATH stays unset.
    1. -PfxBase64 / -PfxPassword  (a real or shared code-signing cert, e.g. from CI secrets) — the
       cert's subject DN MUST match -Publisher (which is stamped into the manifest Identity).
    2. otherwise an EPHEMERAL self-signed code-signing cert with subject = -Publisher is generated
       in-process. The package installs only where that cert is trusted, so the matching public
       .cer is exported next to the .msix for the user to import (Trusted People) before install.
       This fallback is for canary/CI/dev ONLY: on a v* tag build a missing cert is a hard failure
       (-RequireSignedCert), never a silent downgrade to a throwaway cert.

  WHICHEVER mode runs, the signed .msix is read back and its signer subject compared to -Publisher;
  a mismatch fails the build. MSIX package identity is Name + Publisher, so a publisher that does
  not match the signer is not a cosmetic problem — Add-AppxPackage rejects the package outright,
  and it would only be discovered by a user trying to install the release.

  Run on the Windows runner (or the dev VM) with the MSVC/Windows SDK present.
