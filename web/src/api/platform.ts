// The console's only platform gate (design/web-console-overhaul.md §3).
//
// Two questions, two sources, and they are not interchangeable:
//
//   IDENTITY — `HostInfo.os` — picks icons, docs anchors and platform wording.
//   CONTROL  — the `enforced` array of a settings plane — decides whether a control
//              is rendered at all.
//
// A control gated on identity is a second source of truth that drifts from the host: the
// old EDID toggle asked "is there an AMD GPU?" as a proxy for "does `atiadlxx.dll` load?",
// which the host alone can answer. Gate on `enforced`; a leak is then one host-side fix.
